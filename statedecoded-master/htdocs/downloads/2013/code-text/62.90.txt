  HOUSE MOVERS – METHODS OF MOVING – RULES AND REGULATIONS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 108,646, Eff. 2/3/57.)	It shall be the duty of any house
mover, when required by the Board, to cause boards of sufficient strength to
carry the load, without breaking to be placed under all of the rollers or wheels
to serve as a runway for such rollers or wheels during the removal of any
building or structure, or section or portion thereof, along every street
improved in any other manner than by asphalt or concrete. At no time shall such
rollers or wheels be permitted to revolve except upon such board runway when the
same is required by the Board.	All buildings shall be loaded on equipment having
rubber-tired wheels.	In the event that the equipment of the house mover is not
sufficient for the work required, or if a street or the use thereof, or the
property of any public utility will be at any time endangered or damaged by such
removal, or if such house mover, or his servants or employees at any time
violate any of the terms, conditions or restrictions of the permit required by
Sec. 62.84, either as to the size of dimensions of the building or structure
being removed, or the route of such removal or otherwise, the authorized
inspector shall be empowered to stop the progress of such removal and shall
report such fact to the Board.	The Board may adopt such rules and regulations as
in its judgment may be needed to control the moving, the size, the weight, the
equipment, the personnel, or any safety device necessary to safeguard the public
interest safety, welfare and property in all matters pertaining to house moving.
