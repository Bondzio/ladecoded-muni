	A.	Permitted.&#xA0; Pole signs shall not be permitted on that portion of a lot having less than 50 feet of street frontage.&#xA0; Lots having a street frontage of at least 50 feet may have a pole sign for each 200 feet or fraction of that area of street frontage, if the street frontage does not contain an existing pole sign or projecting sign.

	B.	Area.

	1.	Sign area visible to the same direction of traffic shall not exceed two square feet for each foot of street frontage, plus one square foot for each foot of building frontage.

	2.	The maximum area of any one pole sign shall not exceed 400 square feet.

	3.	Any pole sign that is located at the street corner of a corner lot may use the greater street frontage for area limitations.

	4.	The combined sign area of pole signs, projecting signs, monument signs, illuminated architectural canopy signs, wall signs, roof signs and window signs shall not exceed four square feet for each foot of street frontage.

	C.	Height.&#xA0; Height shall be measured from the nearest sidewalk or edge of roadway grade to the top of the sign.&#xA0; The overall height limitation shall be determined by street frontage as follows:

	1.	25 feet for lots having 50 feet of street frontage;&#xA0;

	2.	35 feet for lots having more than 50 feet and less than 100 feet of street frontage; and

	3.	42 feet for lots having at least 100 feet of street frontage.

	Any pole sign that is located at the street corner of a corner lot may use the greater street frontage for determining height limitations.&#xA0; In no event shall a sign exceed the height specified for the height district in which the sign is located.

	D.	Location.

	1.	Pole signs shall be located at least ten feet from interior lot lines; however, on corner lots and flag lots, pole signs may be located five feet from interior lot lines.

	2.	A pole sign shall be located at least 15 feet from any other pole sign, projecting sign or monument sign.

	3.	Pole signs shall be located so as not to interfere or present a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic.

	4.	Where the lower part of a pole sign is less than eight feet above sidewalk grade or the edge of roadway grade nearest the sign, the sign shall extend to grade or shall be installed in a planter that extends beyond the edges of the sign and sign support structure and that is a minimum of 18 inches in height.

	E.	Projections.&#xA0; A pole sign may project over a building line, but shall not extend beyond the limits shown in Diagram A of this article.&#xA0; Sign projections shall fall within an area that is perpendicular to the building line and has a width of three feet as measured parallel to the building line.

	F.	Other Requirements.&#xA0; A maximum of two poles shall be permitted for any pole sign.&#xA0; The maximum cross-sectional dimension of a pole shall not exceed ten percent of the overall height of the sign.</full_text><order_by>4.12</order_by><ancestry><unit id="58" label="article"><name>Sign Regulations</name><identifier>4.4</identifier><url>/1/4.4/</url></unit><unit id="7" label="chapter"><name>General Provisions and Zoning</name><identifier>1</identifier><url>/1/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="2634"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.1</section_number><catch_line>Purpose.</catch_line><url>/14.4.1/</url><token>14.4.1</token></unit><unit id="3043"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.10</section_number><catch_line>Wall Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.10/</url><token>14.4.10</token></unit><unit id="2490"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.11</section_number><catch_line>Illuminated Architectural Canopy Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.11/</url><token>14.4.11</token></unit><unit id="1687"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.12</section_number><catch_line>Pole Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.12/</url><token>14.4.12</token></unit><unit id="776"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.13</section_number><catch_line>Roof Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.13/</url><token>14.4.13</token></unit><unit id="2351"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.14</section_number><catch_line>Window Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.14/</url><token>14.4.14</token></unit><unit id="1912"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.15</section_number><catch_line>Marquee Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.15/</url><token>14.4.15</token></unit><unit id="2518"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.16</section_number><catch_line>Temporary Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.16/</url><token>14.4.16</token></unit><unit id="2804"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.17</section_number><catch_line>Temporary Signs On Temporary Construction Walls.</catch_line><url>/14.4.17/</url><token>14.4.17</token></unit><unit id="3167"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.18</section_number><catch_line>Off-Site Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.18/</url><token>14.4.18</token></unit><unit id="2230"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.19</section_number><catch_line>Awning Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.19/</url><token>14.4.19</token></unit><unit id="831"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.2</section_number><catch_line>Definitions.</catch_line><url>/14.4.2/</url><token>14.4.2</token></unit><unit id="2193"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.20</section_number><catch_line>Mural Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.20/</url><token>14.4.20</token></unit><unit id="3521"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.3</section_number><catch_line>Application.</catch_line><url>/14.4.3/</url><token>14.4.3</token></unit><unit id="1865"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.4</section_number><catch_line>General Provisions.</catch_line><url>/14.4.4/</url><token>14.4.4</token></unit><unit id="1501"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.5</section_number><catch_line>Hazard To Traffic.</catch_line><url>/14.4.5/</url><token>14.4.5</token></unit><unit id="967"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.6</section_number><catch_line>Freeway Exposure.</catch_line><url>/14.4.6/</url><token>14.4.6</token></unit><unit id="165"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.7</section_number><catch_line>Information Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.7/</url><token>14.4.7</token></unit><unit id="1157"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.8</section_number><catch_line>Monument Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.8/</url><token>14.4.8</token></unit><unit id="3038"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.9</section_number><catch_line>Projecting Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.9/</url><token>14.4.9</token></unit></structure_contents><next_section id="776"><structure_id>58</structure_id><section_number>14.4.13</section_number><catch_line>Roof Signs.</catch_line><url>/14.4.13/</url><token>14.4.13</token></next_section><metadata></metadata><references></references><url>/14.4.12/</url><token>14.4.12</token><formats><txt>/14.4.12.txt</txt><json>/14.4.12.xml</json></formats><dublin_core><Title>Pole Signs.</Title><Type>Text</Type><Format>text/html</Format><Identifier>&#xA7; 14.4.12</Identifier><Relation>Los Angeles Municipal Code</Relation></dublin_core><plain_text>                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE
