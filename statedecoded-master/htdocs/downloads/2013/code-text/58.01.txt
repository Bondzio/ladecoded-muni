  NUISANCES – SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)

	When the Health Officer, acting under any authority vested in him or her,
orders the abatement of a nuisance or condition within the City of Los Angeles
that endangers the public health, safety and welfare, and the person or persons
responsible for the creation or maintenance of the nuisance fail to comply with
the order, the Health Officer may request the Department of Public Works or any
other department having the necessary workforce and equipment, to perform the
work required to abate the nuisance.

	All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall be a personal obligation
against the person or persons responsible for the creation or maintenance of the
nuisance and the owner of the property, recoverable by the City in an action
before any court of competent jurisdiction.  These costs shall include an
amount equal to 40 percent of the cost to perform the actual work, but not less
than the sum of $100.00, to cover the City’s costs for administering any
contract and supervising the work required.  In addition to this personal
obligation and all other remedies provided by law, the City may collect any
judgment, fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees, fines, late charges,
or interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this section as provided
in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.
