AUTHORIZATION OF COLLECTIONS. (§ 21.5.07)

  AUTHORIZATION OF COLLECTIONS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 137,733, Eff. 12/30/68.)	Every retailer maintaining a
place of business in the City of Los Angeles shall apply to the Director of
Finance for authorization to collect the tax hereby imposed from any person
purchasing property from such retailer, the use or consumption of which is
taxable hereunder. Upon receipt of any application in such form as required by
him, the Director of Finance may authorize the applicant to make such
collections and to forward the same to the Director of Finance. Nothing in this
article, however, shall require a retailer maintaining places of business both
within and outside the City to collect the tax imposed under this article from
persons who purchase property from a place of business maintained by such
retailer outside the City.
