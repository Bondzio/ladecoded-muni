	(Added by Ord. No. 180,219, Eff. 11/16/08.)

	A.	Purpose.&#xA0; This section sets forth procedures, guidelines and standards for the establishment of &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay Districts in areas of the City that are proximate to colleges and universities.&#xA0; The purpose of the NSO District is to protect and preserve the existing low density housing stock; to maintain and enhance the quality of life of area residents; to promote well-planned student housing; to establish regulations that address the negative impacts multi-habitable room projects cause; to address inadequate parking; to prevent irreversible damage associated with oversized multi-habitable room projects and to help stabilize neighborhoods.&#xA0; The purpose of the NSO District is also to ensure that future Projects are designed to be compatible with buildings that are adjacent or across the street.

	B.	Establishment of the District.

	1.	Requirements.&#xA0; Each application for the establishment of a &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 12.32 S. of this Code, except that each &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District shall include only properties in the R2, RD, R3, RAS, R4, R5, CR, C1, C1.5, C2, C4, C5 or CM zones.

	2.	Radius.&#xA0; The radius of a &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District shall be at least one-quarter mile and no more than one mile from the physical boundaries of a college or university.&#xA0; The District shall not generally be less than one-quarter mile radius wide.

	3.	Boundaries.&#xA0; The boundaries shall be along street frontages and shall not split parcels.&#xA0; The precise boundary of a District may be adjusted for urban features such as topography, freeways or streets / highways.&#xA0; Precise boundaries are required at the time of application for or initiation of an individual District.&#xA0; The &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District shall include contiguous parcels of residentially and commercially zoned parcels, which may only be separated by public streets, ways or alleys or other physical features, or as set forth in the rules approved by the Director of Planning.&#xA0; A &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District may encompass an area that is designated, in whole or in part, as a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone and/or Specific Plan area.

	4.	Definitions.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, the following definitions shall apply to this section:

	Affordable Housing Units.&#xA0; Dwelling units or guest rooms for which rental payments do not exceed the limits established by the Housing Department for persons and families whose income does not exceed 30%-120% of Area Median Income (AMI), adjusted for family size by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in accordance with adjustment factors established and amended from time to time pursuant to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937.&#xA0; The income limits are defined as lower, low, moderate, very low, or extremely low income households in Sections 50079.5, 50093, 50105 and 50106 of the California Health and Safety Code.

	Area Median Income (AMI).&#xA0; The median income in Los Angeles County as determined annually by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) or any successor agency, adjusted for household size.

	Project.&#xA0; The construction, erection, addition to, enlargement of or reconfiguration of any one-family dwelling or multiple-family dwelling units or portions of dwelling units in the R2, RD, R3, RAS, R4, R5, CR, C1, C1.5, C2, C4, C5 or CM zones that create at least one dwelling unit with five or more habitable rooms.

	A project shall not include any of the following uses:

	(1)	Dormitories on an official college or university campus; or

	(2)	Any qualifying Affordable Housing Units.

	5.	Findings.&#xA0; In order to establish a &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District, the City Council shall find that Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay regulations will protect and enhance the character of the District by regulating building bulk caused by buildings with five or more habitable rooms per unit; and that the District is negatively impacted by excessive on-street parking resulting from residential units designed for student housing, which do not provide adequate off-street parking.

	C.	Development Regulations.&#xA0; All property within a District shall be subject to the following conditions:

	1.	Building Permit.&#xA0; The Department of Building and Safety shall not issue a building permit for a Project within a &#x201C;NSO&#x201D; Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District unless a conditional use approval has been granted pursuant to Section 12.24 W.52. of this Code.

	2.	Parking Requirements.&#xA0; Any Project shall, in addition to complying with the parking requirements of Section 12.21 A.4.(a) of this Code, also provide one additional parking space for each habitable room at or above five habitable rooms.</full_text><order_by>12</order_by><ancestry><unit id="43" label="article"><name>Specific Plan &#x2013; Zoning
