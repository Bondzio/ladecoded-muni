  MANIFOLD ACCESSORIES.	A.	Except for atmospheric gases and inert gases each
container lead shall be attached to the manifold header through a back-flow
check valve, and a manually operated shut-off valve.	B.	Pressure regulators
shall be provided at the point where service piping is connected to the
manifold, and at station outlets where required for further reduction of
pressure.	C.	Every manifold containing liquefied gases shall be provided with a
pressure relief valve. Every manifold containing nonliquefied gases shall have a
pressure relief valve on the reduced pressure side.	D.	Relief valves on
manifolds containing flammable or toxic materials shall be equipped with vent
lines of cross-sectional area at least equal to that of the relief valve and
such vent lines shall extend out-of-doors to a safe location at least two feet
above any roof within ten feet and at least ten feet above the adjacent grade
