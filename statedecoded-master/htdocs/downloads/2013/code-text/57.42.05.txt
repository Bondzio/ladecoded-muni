DESIGN PRESSURE. (§ 57.42.05)

  DESIGN PRESSURE.	A.	The minimum design pressure for containers used for the
storage of liquid or liquefied materials shall be dependent upon the vapor
pressure of the stored material and upon the volume/surface ratio of the vessel
as set forth in this section.	1.	When the volume/surface ratio is equal to or
less than 1.0, the design pressure shall not be less than the vapor pressure (in
psig) of the stored material at 115° F.	2.	When the volume surface/ratio is two
or more, the design pressure shall be not less than the vapor pressure (in psig)
of the stored material at 100° F.	3.	When the volume/surface ratio is greater
than one but less than two, the design pressure shall not be less than the
straight line interpolation between that required by paragraphs one and two of
this subsection.	B.	The design pressure for containers used for the storage of
nonliquefied gaseous materials hall be such as to allow for the heating of the
contents to a gas temperature of 130° F.	C.	The minimum design pressure for
containers used for processing shall be not less than 100 percent of the
operating pressure (in psig at the operating temperature.)	D.	When a pressure
vessel is used for both storage and processing, the minimum design pressure
shall be not less than the maximum design pressure required under this section.
