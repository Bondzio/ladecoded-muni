OPERATOR’S DUTIES. (§ 21.15.4)

  OPERATOR’S DUTIES.	Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this
article to the same extent and at the same time as the parking fee is collected
from every occupant. In all cases in which the tax is not collected by the
operator from the occupant, the operator shall be liable to the City for the
amount of tax due on the amount of the taxable parking fee collected from the
occupant under the provisions of this article the same as though the tax were
paid by the occupant. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the
amount of the parking fee charged, and each occupant, upon demand, shall be
given a receipt for payment. No operator shall advertise or hold out or state to
the public or any occupant, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator or that it will not be added
to the parking fee for the parking space, or that, if added, it or any part
thereof will be refunded.
