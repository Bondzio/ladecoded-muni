  RENT INCREASES.
	(Added by Ord. No. 173,011, Eff. 1/30/00.)	If an order is made under Section
161.805, regardless whether the building or dwelling unit is subject to the RSO,
the landlord may not increase the rent for the existing tenants of any dwelling
unit that is the subject of the order from the date of the order to a period of
one year after the Department determines that the landlord has complied with the
order.  The determination shall include the date of the landlord’s compliance
for purposes of calculating the one year period.	If the building or dwelling
unit is subject to the RSO, any automatic increase pursuant to Section 151.06
will not take effect for a period of one year after the Department determines
that the landlord has complied with the order.	For a building or dwelling unit
that is subject to the RSO, if the landlord applies for an individual rent
adjustment pursuant to Section 151.07, any authorized rent adjustment will not
take effect for a period of one year after the Department determines that the
landlord has complied with the order.  (Para. Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff.
