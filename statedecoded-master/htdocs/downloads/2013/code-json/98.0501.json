No. 171,668, Eff. 8\/28\/97.)\u00a0 Upon request by an applicant and accepted by the Department, an off-hour processing fee per Section 98.0422 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code may be collected for processing of evaluation reports for alternate materials.\n\n\t(d)\tRenewal.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 169,867, Eff. 7\/17\/94.)\u00a0 Upon expiration of an approval or upon any change in design, material, method of construction or model designation made during the period of approval, it shall be unlawful to sell, offer for sale or use a product until a renewal has been approved under provisions of this section.\n\n\t(e)\tRequests For Extension of Time.\u00a0 (Added by Ord.
