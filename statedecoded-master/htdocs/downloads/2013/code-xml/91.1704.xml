requirements of Section 91.1704.1.4, Registered Deputy Inspectors shall keep
records of inspections.&#xA0; The Registered Deputy Inspector shall furnish
inspection reports to the Superintendent of Building and to the registered
design professional in charge.&#xA0; Reports shall indicate that work inspected was
done in conformance with approved construction documents.&#xA0; Discrepancies shall
be brought to the immediate attention of the contractor for correction.&#xA0; If the
discrepancies are not corrected, the discrepancies shall be brought to the
attention of the Superintendent of Building and to the registered design
professional in responsible charge prior to the completion of that phase of the
work.&#xA0; A final report documenting required special inspections and correction

time agreed upon by the permit applicant and the Superintendent of Building
prior to the start of work.91.1704.1.3.&#xA0; Registered Deputy Inspector.&#xA0;
Application for registration as a Registered Deputy Inspector shall be made to
the Superintendent of Building on a form furnished by the Department.&#xA0; A
separate application shall be made for each type of registration desired.&#xA0;
Registration is available for the following types of inspections:&#xA0; Reinforced
Concrete (RC), Structural Masonry (SM), Structural Steel/Welding (SSW), Grading
(GD), Sprayed Fire resistant Materials (SFRM), Methane Barrier (MB) and Wood
(WD).&#xA0;	A committee appointed by the Superintendent of Building shall examine
each applicant as to his or her experience and training for performing the
duties of an inspector of the type for which application has been made.&#xA0;
Additionally, the applicant will be examined on the applicant&#x2019;s knowledge of
the Los Angeles Municipal Code and Register Deputy Inspector duties,
responsibilities and procedures.&#xA0; When satisfied as to the fitness of the
applicant, the Superintendent of Building shall issue a Certificate of
Registration.&#xA0; Upon application for renewal of a Certificate of Registration,
the applicant shall be reexamined to ascertain the applicant&#x2019;s fitness to
perform the duties of inspector of the type for which application has been
made.	EXCEPTION:&#xA0; If the Department determines that the initial examination
(which includes general knowledge, code requirements and plan comprehension) for
the special inspector program under the International Code Council (ICC) is
equivalent to the above-described initial or renewal examination, then the
Department may accept the results of the ICC examination in lieu of the
Department&#x2019;s examination in that category; however, the Department will be
examining the applicant&#x2019;s knowledge of the Los Angeles Municipal Code and
deputy inspector duties, responsibilities and procedures.	The Superintendent of
Building shall issue separate Certificate of Registration for each type of
registration requiring special inspection in accordance with Sections 91.1704
and 91.1707 of this Code and as determined by the Superintendent of Building for
any construction requiring either continuous or periodic special
inspection.	Nothing here shall be deemed to prohibit any one person from being
qualified for more than one type of special inspection, provided he or she
applies, pays the required fees, takes the required examinations and is duly
qualified by the Superintendent of Building for each type.	Each Certificate of
Registration shall expire three years from the date of issuance, but may be
renewed by the Superintendent of Building within a grace period of 30 days
thereafter.	The Department shall maintain a list of the names of all Registered
Deputy Inspectors, showing the type of work each has been authorized to
inspect.&#xA0; This list shall be available to the public.	Upon evidence
satisfactory to the Superintendent of Building of incompetence, of willful or
negligent failure to observe or report violations of this Code, or of any other
failure to perform properly and effectively the duties assumed by a Registered
Deputy Inspector, the Superintendent of Building may revoke, suspend or refuse
to renew any Certificate of Registration.&#xA0; But prior to that action, the holder
shall be given an opportunity to appear before the Superintendent of Building
and be heard.	Except where there is an employee of the City of Los Angeles
inspecting buildings or structures being erected or repaired by the City, no
Registered Deputy Inspector shall receive any compensation whatsoever from the
City.&#xA0; A Registered Deputy Inspector shall undertake and perform the duties of
inspection solely on the request of the owner or the owner&#x2019;s agent.&#xA0; The
designation shall be deemed to indicate that the duties incident to the
inspection are within the course and scope of the Registered Deputy
Inspector&#x2019;s employment by the owner or agent, and except where the Registered
Deputy Inspector is in fact an employee of the City, the Registered Deputy
Inspector shall not be deemed an employee of the City, the contractor, a
subcontractor or a material vendor for any purpose.91.1704.1.4.&#xA0; Duties and

shall submit a report to the Department setting forth the portion of the work
inspected.&#xA0; The report shall be made on forms supplied by the Department and
shall be filed in the records of the Department.	2.	Nothing here shall be deemed
to authorize any Registered Deputy Inspector to approve any inspection required
by this Code, other than the special inspection for which the Registered Deputy
Inspector was hired.	3.	Where, in the opinion of the Department, the magnitude
or complexity of a job warrants it, additional Registered Deputy Inspectors may
be required.	4.	Where, in the opinion of the Department, the Registered Deputy
