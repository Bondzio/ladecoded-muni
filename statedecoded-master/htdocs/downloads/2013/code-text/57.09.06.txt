that consideration must be given to simultaneous fires, and additional 2,000 to
8,000 G.P.M. will be required).
      
    
  
	1.	Where street alignments mandate the installation of dead-end mains, the
fire-flow in gallons per minute may be adjusted downward, depending on the type
of land development.	2.	A minimum residual water pressure of 20 pounds per
square inch is to remain in the system with the required gallons per minute
flowing.	3.	(Repealed by Ord. No. 167,326, Eff. 11/16/91.)	B.	Fire hydrant

	*	This figure will be systematically reduced where greater fire- flow is
required due to restricted access, depth of lots, length of blocks, or
additional hazards.	1.	Every first story dwelling unit, first story guest room,
and all first story portions of any commercial or industrial building must be
within 300 feet of an approved fire hydrant.	2.	All fire hydrants shall have
21/2&#038;″ x 4&#038;″ outlets or 4&#038;″ x 4&#038;″ outlets and
conform to the minimum standards of the American Water Works Association for wet
barrel hydrants. A minimum of one fire hydrant is to be provided at each
intersection. “Built-up” type single 2-1/2&#038;″ outlet hydrants
(6&#038;″ pipe surmounted by an angle valve) shall be used in areas having a
static water pressure of 210 P.S.I. or more.	3.	Streets with raised median
center dividers, excessive traffic loads, or more than 80 feet in dedicated
width require the installation of hydrants on both sides of the street.
Additional intermediate hydrants are required in areas where restricted access,
depth of lots, or blocks exceeding the maximum hydrant spacing intervals
exist.	C.	Land use and required fire flow.  (Added by Ord. No. 169,944, Eff.

	*	Land use designations are contained in the community  plan elements of the
General Plan for the City of Los Angeles.	**	The maximum response distance to
LAFD fire stations pertains to areas outside the boundaries covered by the
Hillside Ordinance (Ordinance Number 168,159). When a portion of any
subdivision, as that term is defined in Section 17.02 of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code, falls outside of the one and one-half mile distance requirement,
automatic fire sprinklers will not be required in that portion whenever a review
by the Chief has determined that no unacceptable increase in hazard to the
public will result.	*** 	The maximum response distances for both LAFD fire
suppression companies (engine and truck) must be satisfied.
