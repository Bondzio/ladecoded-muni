(For boundaries of such districts and any conditions applicable thereto, refer to maps and records in the City Planning Office.) (Added by Ord. No. 156,166, Eff. 1\/24\/82.)\tH.\tDrilling Site Requirements.\u00a0 Any person desiring to drill, deepen or maintain an oil well in an oil drilling district that has been established by ordinance, or to drill or deepen and subsequently maintain an oil well in the M3 Zone within 500 feet of a more restrictive zone shall file an application in the Department of City Planning on a form provided by the Department, requesting a determination of the conditions under which the operations may be conducted.\u00a0 (Para. Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10\/10\/00.)\tWhere the district is in an urbanized or off-shore area, a Zoning Administrator, after investigation, may deny the application if he finds that there is available and reasonably obtainable in the same district or in an adjacent or nearby district within a reasonable distance one or more locations where drilling could be done with greater safety and security with appreciably less harm to other property, or with greater conformity to the comprehensive zoning map.\u00a0 A Zoning Administrator shall deny an application for a drill site in an urbanized or off-shore area unless the applicant first files with the Zoning Administrator in a form and executed in a manner approved by a Zoning Administrator\t(1)\teither of the following continuing written offers\t(a)\tto make the drill site available to competing operators upon reasonable terms, or\t(b)\tto enter into or conduct joint operations for a unit or cooperative plan of development of hydrocarbon reserves upon reasonable terms, if whichever course offered is determined to be feasible by a Zoning Administrator, and is subsequently required by him or her in order to effectuate the above set forth purposes, and\t(2)\tan agreement to abide by the determination of the Director of Administrative and Research Services if any dispute arises as to the reasonableness of those terms after first having an opportunity to be heard.\u00a0 Where the district is in a nonurbanized area, in the Los Angeles City Oil Field Area, or in those cases where a Zoning Administrator approves an application in an urbanized or off-shore area, a Zoning Administrator shall determine and prescribe additional conditions or limitations, not in conflict with those specified in the ordinance establishing the district, which he or she deems appropriate in order to give effect to the provisions of this section and to other provisions of this chapter relating to zoning.\u00a0 Where the proposed operation is in the M3 Zone and is within 500 feet of a more restrictive zone, a Zoning Administrator shall prescribe conditions and limitations, if any, as he or she deems appropriate to regulate activity which may be materially detrimental to property in the more restrictive zone.\u00a0 All conditions previously imposed by a Zoning Administrator in accordance with the provisions of this chapter are continued in full force and effect.\tA Zoning Administrator shall make his or her written determination within 60 days from the date of the filing of an application and shall forthwith transmit a copy to the applicant.\tThe determination shall become final after an elapsed period of 15 days from the mailing of the notification to the applicant, unless an appeal is filed within that period, in which case the provisions of Section 12.24B through I concerning the filing and consideration of appeals shall apply.\tI.\tPermits.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 173,268, Eff. 7\/1\/00, Oper. 7\/1\/00.)\u00a0 No person shall drill, deepen or maintain an oil well or convert an oil well from one class to the other and no permits shall be issued for that use, until a determination has been made by the Zoning Administrator or Area Planning Commission pursuant to the procedure prescribed in Subsection H of this section.\tJ.\tTermination of District. Any ordinance establishing the districts described in this section shall become null and void one year after the effective date thereof unless oil drilling operations are commenced and diligently prosecuted within such one\u2013year period, provided, however, a Zoning Administrator, upon recommendation of the Director of the Office of Administrative and Research Services, may extend the termination date for four consecutive additional periods not to exceed one year each, prior to the termination date of each period, if written request is filed therefor with the office of the Zoning Administration setting forth the reasons for said request and a Zoning Administrator determines that good and reasonable cause exists therefor. (Amended by Ord. No. 173,363, Eff. 7\/29\/00, Oper. 7\/1\/00.)\tSimilarly, a Zoning Administrator, upon recommendation of the City Administrative Officer, may extend the termination date for three consecutive additional periods not to exceed one year each, prior to the termination date of each period, for those districts which are part of a group undergoing development from one or more common controlled drilling sites, provided that written request is filed, which sets forth the reasons for the request therefor and the Zoning Administrator determines that good and reasonable cause exists therefor, and providing further that drilling operations have been diligently prosecuted from the common controlled drilling site during the previous extension period. Additional one\u2013year extensions may be made by a Zoning Administrator subject to the approval of the City Planning Commission. (Amended by Ord. No. 134,135, Eff. 4\/28\/67.)\tAny ordinance establishing an urbanized oil district shall become null and void one year after all wells drilled in the district after the effective date of said ordinance have been abandoned in accordance with legal requirements, unless a Zoning Administrator determines that the district is part of a group undergoing development from one or more common, controlled drilling sites, or on the basis of sufficient proof determines that production is allocated thereto from an adjacent, adjoining or near by drilling district or districts under a unit or pooling agreement. In such cases a Zoning Administrator may if he finds that good and reasonable cause exists therefor, extend the termination date of the expiring district to coincide with the termination date of the other district or districts in which the one or more common controlled drilling sites are located or from which production is allocated under a unit or pooling agreement. A Zoning Administrator may terminate any such district when the reasons for such extension no longer apply. (Amended by Ord. No. 134,135, Eff. 4\/28\/67.)\tAny ordinance establishing a non\u2013urbanized district or district in the Los Angeles City Oil Field Area shall become null and void one year after all wells in the district have been abandoned in accordance with legal requirements, unless the Zoning Administrator, on the basis of sufficient proof, determines that the district is part of a group in which secondary hydrocarbon recovery operations are taking place, and that production from an adjoining or adjacent district is allocated thereto under a unit or pooling agreement. In such cases, a Zoning Administrator may, if he finds that good and reasonable cause exists therefor, extend the termination date to coincide with the termination date of the adjoining or adjacent district in which secondary recovery operations are being conducted. A Zoning Administrator may terminate any such district when the reasons for said extension no longer apply. (Amended by Ord.

Effective August 1,1962, the following regulations shall apply to existing and future oil wells within the City of Los Angeles, including oil wells operating pursuant to any zone variance, whether by ordinance or approval of a Zoning Administrator, and all oil wells in an M3 Zone which are within 500 feet of a more restrictive zone:\t1.\tAll stationary derricks, including their floors and foundations, shall be removed within 30 days after completion or abandonment of the well (notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code to the contrary) or by September 1, 1962, whichever occurs later; and thereafter any work done on any existing well which requires the use of a derrick shall be done by a temporary or portable derrick. Such temporary or portable derricks shall be removed within 30 days after the completion of such work.\t2.\tThe motors, engines, pumps and tanks of all such oil wells shall be sealed so that no offensive or obnoxious odor or fumes can be readily detected from any point on adjacent property.\t3.\tThe well pumping equipment for such wells shall be muffled or soundproofed so that the noise emanating therefrom, measured from any point on adjacent property, is no more audible than surrounding street traffic, commercial or industrial noises measured at the same point.\t4.\tThe maximum height of the pumping units for such wells shall not exceed 15 feet above existing grade level.\t5.\tThe site of such wells shall be so landscaped, fenced or concealed that the well and all of its appurtenant apparatus is reasonably protected against public entry, observation or attraction.\tIn addition to any other authority vested in the Zoning Administrator by Charter and the Los Angeles Municipal Code, a Zoning Administrator may waive or modify these regulations if the drilling site is physically inaccessible to a portable derrick, or is located in a mountainous and substantially uninhabited place, or is located in an M Zone and is surrounded by vacant land or is adjacent to land used as permitted in the M Zones and if the enforcement of such regulations would be discriminatory, unreasonable or would impose a undue hardship upon oil drilling in such locations. A Zoning Administrator may also waive or modify the 16\u2013foot height limitation where, because of the amount of liquid to be raised or the depths at which such fluids are encountered, pumping unit in excess of 16 feet in height is shown by conclusive engineering evidence to be required. (Amended by Ord. No. 125,877, Eff. 11\/29\/63.)\tAll ordinances and parts of ordinances of the City of Los Angeles in conflict herewith are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict.","type":"section","prefixes":[""],"prefix":"","entire_prefix":"","prefix_anchor":"","level":1}},"previous_section":{"id":"3777","structure_id":"43","section_number":"13.00","catch_line":"Establishment Of Districts.","url":"\/13.00\/","token":"13.00"}}
