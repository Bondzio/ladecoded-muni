NOTICE OF DEFENSE. (§ 102.05)

  NOTICE OF DEFENSE.	(a)	Time of Filing.  Within 10 days after service upon
him of the accusation the respondent may file with the Board one or more notices
of defense in which he may:	1.	Request a hearing;	2.	Object to the accusation
upon the ground that it does not state acts or omissions upon which the Board
may proceed;	3.	Object to the form of the accusation on the ground that it is so
indefinite or uncertain that he can not identify the transaction or prepare his
defense;	4.	Admit the accusation in whole or in part.	(b)	Failure to File –
Waiver.  The respondent shall be entitled to a hearing on the merits if he
files a notice of defense within 10 days, and any such notice shall be deemed a
specific denial of all parts of the accusation not expressly admitted. Failure
to file such notice shall constitute a waiver of respondent’s rights to a
hearing, but the Board in its discretion may nevertheless grant a hearing. 
Unless objection is taken as provided in this section, all objections to the
form of the accusation shall be deemed waived.	(c)	Written Notice of Defense. 
The notice of defense shall be in writing signed by or on behalf of the
respondent and shall state his mailing address.  It need not be verified or
follow any particular form.
