RAILROAD – STAGE DEPOT – SOLICITING PATRONAGE. (§ 42.06)

  RAILROAD – STAGE DEPOT – SOLICITING PATRONAGE.	(a)	No person shall
solicit custom or patronage for any purpose for or on behalf of himself or any
other person in any railroad or automobile stage depot or grounds.	(b)	No person
shall stand or park any vehicle owned, operated or under the control of said
person in any railroad or automobile stage depot, grounds or premises.	(c)	The
provisions of this section shall not apply to any person who, with the written
consent of the owner, lessee or managing agent of said railroad or automobile
stage depot, park or stand any vehicle used or intended for use in transporting
persons or property to or from such depot, grounds or premises; nor to persons
maintaining booths for the information, accommodation or convenience of the
traveling public with the written consent of the owner, lessee or managing agent
of such railroad or automobile stage depot.	The provisions of this subsection
shall not be regarded as soliciting within the meaning of this section.	An
ordinance which prohibits solicitation of patronage for transportation in or
about a depot without consent of the owner does not constitute unlawful
discrimination between persons who have and others who have not such consent,
and is valid.
