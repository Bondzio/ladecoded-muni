                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

PURPOSE AND INTENT. (§ 49.84.1)

  PURPOSE AND INTENT.

	(A)	The City Council of the City of Los Angeles finds graffiti on public or
private property a blighting element that leads to depreciation of the value of
property and depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties to
the extent that graffiti creates a negative impact on the entire city.

	(B)	The City Council finds and determines that the power of graffiti to create
fear and insecurity within the community detracts from the sense of community
enjoyed by residents making graffiti both a property crime and a social crime
impacting the quality of life and freedom from intimidation that citizens desire
within their neighborhoods.

	(C)	The City Council finds and determines that the spread of graffiti often
leads to violence, genuine threats to life, and the perpetuation of gangs, gang
violence, and gang territories.

	(D)	The City Council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a
public nuisance, and must be eliminated by means of prevention, education, and
abatement to avoid the detrimental impact of such graffiti on the City and its
residents, and to prevent the further spread of graffiti.

	(E)	The purpose and intent of the City Council, through the adoption of this
Article, is to protect public and private property from acts of vandalism and
defacement.
