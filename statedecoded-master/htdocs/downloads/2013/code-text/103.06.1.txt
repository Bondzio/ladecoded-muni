  PERMITS – RENEWAL.
	(Added by Ord. No. 175,676, Eff. 1/11/04.)	A request for an annual permit
renewal must be accompanied by a completed renewal form.	Any change or
alteration in the nature or operation of the business will require the renewal
to be reviewed by the Board.  Any changed circumstance, which would have been
grounds for denial of the application, suspension or revocation of the permit,
is grounds for denying the permittee a renewed permit.  Denial of a renewal
permit under this section shall proceed in accordance with the procedures set
out in Sections 103.32 and 103.33.
