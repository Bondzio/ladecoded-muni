OVERLOADS – WHERE EXCEPTIONS ARE PERMISSIBLE. (§ 62.150)

  OVERLOADS – WHERE EXCEPTIONS ARE PERMISSIBLE.	Whenever the Board shall
determine that the interests of the national defense or public safety require
that any overload be moved at a time or in a manner not permitted by the express
provisions of the article, it may endorse upon the permit an express exemption
from any such particular provisions, which exemption shall be effective as to
any overload moved under that permit. The Board may attach such conditions to
any such exception as it may deem reasonable to be required for public safety or
the protection of property, including a requirement of fair indemnity on behalf
of the City, members of the public, or both.  (Amended by Ord. No. 145,625,
Eff. 4/6/74.)
