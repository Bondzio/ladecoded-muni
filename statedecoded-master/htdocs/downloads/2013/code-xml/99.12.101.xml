	This section shall set forth the Voluntary Measures for Newly Constructed Low-Rise Residential Buildings.

A5.105.1.1.&#xA0; Existing Building Structure.&#xA0; Maintain at least 75 percent of existing building structure (including structural floor and roof decking) and envelope (exterior skin and framing) based on surface area.

	EXCEPTIONS:

	1.	Window assemblies and nonstructural roofing material.

	2.	Hazardous materials that are remediated as a part of the project.

A5.105.1.2.&#xA0; Existing Non-Structural Elements.&#xA0; Reuse existing interior non-structural elements (interior walls, doors, floor coverings and ceiling systems) in at least 50 percent of the area of the completed building

A5.106.2.&#xA0; Storm Water Design.&#xA0; Design storm water runoff rate and quantity in conformance with Subsection A5.106.2.1 and storm water runoff quality by Subsection A5.106.2.2, or by local requirements, whichever are stricter.

A5.106.2.1.&#xA0; Storm Water Runoff Rate and Quantity.&#xA0; Implement a storm water management plan resulting in no net increase in rate and quantity of storm water runoff from existing to developed conditions.

	EXCEPTION:&#xA0; If the site is already greater than 50 percent impervious, implement a storm water management plan resulting in a 25 percent decrease in rate and quantity.

A5.106.2.2.&#xA0; Storm Water Runoff Quality.&#xA0; Use post construction treatment control best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate (infiltrate, filter, or treat) storm water runoff from the 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event (for volume-based BMPs) or the runoff produced by a rain event equal to two times the 85th percentile hourly intensity (for flow-based BMPs).

A5.106.4.3.&#xA0; Changing Room.&#xA0; Provide changing/shower facilities for tenant-occupants in accordance with Table A5.106.4.3 or document arrangements with nearby/shower facilities.
