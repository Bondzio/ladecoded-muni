Ord. No. 176,343, Eff. 1/20/05.)	C.	In order to regulate more adequately and
restrict the height and floor area of buildings and structures, each lot shall
include a height district designation.  Height district designations shall be
numbered from 1 to 4, CRA 1 to 4, EZ 1 to 4, and CSA 1 to 4 and shall regulate
the height or floor area of buildings and structures as provided in Sections
12.21.1, 12.21.2, 12.21.3, 12.21.4 and 12.21.5.  The height districts and their
boundaries are shown on the Zoning Map by a combination of zone symbols and
height district number markings, e.g., R2-1, C2-2, M1-3, C1-CRA1, M2-EZ2,
C2-CSA3, etc.  Where a lot is located in more than one height district, the
applicable zone symbol designations shall be separated by a slash mark, e.g.,
R2-CRA/CSA, C2-EZ1/CRA2, etc.  The symbol “HD” preceding height district
number markings, when shown on the Zoning Map or used in a zoning ordinance, is
an abbreviation for the words “height district” and refers to height
districts.  The height districts for the “CW” Zone are the height districts
shown in Section 6 of the Central City West Specific Plan.  The height
districts for the “ADP” Zone are height districts shown in Section 7 of the
Alameda District Specific Plan.  The height districts for the “WC” Zone are

Section 10 of the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment District Specific Plan.
