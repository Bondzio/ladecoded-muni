PURPOSE. (§ 91.9401)

  PURPOSE.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 172,592, Eff. 6/28/99, Oper. 7/1/99.)	The purpose of this
division is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death
or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on existing hillside
buildings constructed on or into slopes in excess of one unit vertical in three
units horizontal (33.3% slope).  Such buildings have been recognized as life
hazardous as a result of partial or complete collapse that occurred during the
Northridge Earthquake.	The provisions of this division are minimum standards for
structural systems established primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life or
injury resulting from earthquakes and will not necessarily prevent loss of life
or injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing building which complies
with these standards.	This division provides voluntary retrofit standards under
which buildings shall be permitted to be structurally analyzed and
retrofitted.  When fully followed, these standards will strengthen the portion
of the structure that is most vulnerable to earthquake damage.
