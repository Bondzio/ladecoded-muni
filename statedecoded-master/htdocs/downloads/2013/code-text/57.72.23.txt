OPEN TANKS AND VATS. (§ 57.72.23)

  OPEN TANKS AND VATS.	A.	Where steam is used to heat or agitate corrosive
materials in tanks, vats or pans or where compressed air is used to agitate such
liquids and such steam or air is supplied from a line in which the pressure is
higher than that which may be safely used to heat or agitate the liquids, a
spring loaded relief valve or other effective means shall be provided in the
line to prevent the delivery of excessive pressures of steam or air to the
tanks.	B.	Such tanks and vats in which corrosive materials are agitated by
compressed air, steam or mechanical means, or are heated, shall have controls so
located that any employee operating them will not be exposed to splashes or
boil-overs.  Where such location is impracticable, equivalent protection shall
be provided by means of shelter, and safe means of escape from shelter shall be
provided.	C.	Tubular gauges on stationary tanks, vats, or containers which
contain corrosive materials shall be shielded to prevent liquid spray from
endangering employees should the gauge break.  All such gauges shall be guarded
when exposed to the hazard of being broken by accidental impact and in all cases
when located less than seven feet above or three feet laterally from working
levels or passageways.  All such gauges shall be provided with valves which can
be readily closed in case of breakage. When practicable, ball-check or other
self-closing valves shall be used.SAFEGUARDS
