OPERATIONS OF PROCESS VESSELS. (§ 57.42.42)

  OPERATIONS OF PROCESS VESSELS.	Where the relief of excess pressure from
process vessels might result in undue hazard to persons or property through
excessive release of flammable or toxic materials, the Chief may require the
operating pressure of process vessels to be a suitable margin below the design
pressure. In determining the required margin, due consideration shall be given
to the operating characteristics of the processes and of the facilities for
relieving excess pressure. As an alternate thereto, the Chief may permit a
system for safe disposal of materials vented from the facilities for relieving
excess pressure.
