	(Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)

91.8813.1.&#xA0; General.&#xA0; This section shall apply to every vacant unreinforced masonry bearing wall building within the scope of this division which has not complied with the requirements contained in this division.

91.8813.2.&#xA0; Enforcement.&#xA0; When the Department determines that a building is within the scope of this section, it shall notify the owner and order the owner to bring the building into compliance with the provisions of this section&#xA0; Compliance with such an order shall be accomplished within the time limits set forth herein and any extensions of time granted by the Department.&#xA0; If the owner does not comply within such time limits, then the Department may order the demolition of the building or structure in accordance with the provisions of Section 91.8903.

91.8813.3&#xA0; Time for Compliance.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)

	1.	For a one-story building with wall anchors installed pursuant to Section 91.8808.3, either before or within 60 days after notice is given by the Department:

	Within 180 days after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall submit to the Department either plans and a structural analysis for the proposed structural alterations of the building necessary to comply with the minimum requirements of this division, or an application for demolition of the building or structure.

	If the owner elects to perform the proposed structural alterations, then within 270 days after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall obtain the necessary permits for strengthening the building or structure; within 90 days of obtaining a permit to strengthen the building, the owner shall commence strengthening work; and within 18 months after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall complete all strengthening work.

	If the owner elects to demolish the building, then within 210 days after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall obtain permits for the demolition of the building or structure; within 21 days of obtaining a demolition permit, the owner shall commence demolition; and within 300 days after notice is given pursuant to this section the owner shall complete the demolition of the building or structure.

	2.	Time for compliance for all other buildings:

	Within 60 days after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall submit to the Department either plans and a structural analysis for the proposed structural alterations of the building necessary to comply with the minimum requirements of this division, or an application for demolition of the building or structure.

	If the owner elects to perform the necessary alterations, then within 120 days after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall obtain the necessary permits for strengthening the building or structure; within 21 days of obtaining a permit, the owner shall begin work; and within 365 days after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall complete all strengthening work.

	If the owner elects to perform the necessary alterations, then within 120 days after notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall obtain the necessary permits for strengthening the building or structure; and within 120 days after obtaining the demolition permit, the owner shall complete the demolition of the building or structure.

91.8813.4.&#xA0; Special Provisions for Damaged Buildings.&#xA0; An unreinforced masonry bearing wall building which is damaged or partially destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or other calamity or act of God or the public enemy shall be repaired or demolished within six months of such damage or destruction.

	1.	Minimum quality mortar shall be determined by laboratory testing in accordance with Section 91.8809.5 of this Code.

	2.	This table is not applicable to buildings of Rating Classification I. Walls of buildings within Rating Classification I shall be analyzed in accordance with Section 91.8808.6 of this Code.

	3.	The minimum mortar shear strengths required in Footnotes 4 and 5 shall be that shear strength without the effect of axial stress in the wall at the point of the test.

	4.	The larger height-to-thickness ratio may be used where mortar shear tests in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of this Code establish a minimum mortar shear strength of not less than 100 psi (690 kPa) or where the tested mortar shear strength is not less than 60 psi (414 kPa) and a visual examination of the vertical wythe-to-wythe wall joint (collar joint) indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage.

	5.	Where a visual examination of the collar joint indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage and the minimum mortar shear strength when established in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of this Code is greater than 30 psi (207 kPa) but less than 60 psi (414 kPa), the allowable height-to-thickness ratio may be determined by linear interpolation between the larger and smaller ratios in direct proportion to the mortar shear strength.

a minimum mortar shear strength of not less than 100 psi (690 kPa) or where the
tested mortar shear strength is not less than 60 psi (414 kPa) and a visual

The minimum mortar shear strengths required in Footnotes 4 and 5 shall be that shear strength without the effect of axial stress in the wall at the point of the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	4.	The larger height-to-thickness ratio may be used where mortar shear tests in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of this Code establish a minimum mortar shear strength of not less than 100 psi (690 kPa) or where the tested mortar shear strength is not less than 60 psi (414 kPa) and a visual examination of the vertical wythe-to-wythe wall joint (collar joint) indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	5.	Where a visual examination of the collar joint indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage and the minimum mortar shear strength when established in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of this Code is greater than 30 psi (207 kPa) but less than 60 psi (414 kPa), the allowable height-to-thickness ratio may be determined by linear interpolation between the larger and smaller ratios in direct proportion to the mortar shear strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The minimum mortar shear strengths required in Footnotes 4 and 5 shall be that shear strength without the effect of axial stress in the wall at the point of the test.	4.	The larger height-to-thickness ratio may be used where mortar shear tests in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of this Code establish a minimum mortar shear strength of not less than 100 psi (690 kPa) or where the tested mortar shear strength is not less than 60 psi (414 kPa) and a visual examination of the vertical wythe-to-wythe wall joint (collar joint) indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage.	5.	Where a visual examination of the collar joint indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage and the minimum mortar shear strength when established in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of this Code is greater than 30 psi (207 kPa) but less than 60 psi (414 kPa), the allowable height-to-thickness ratio may be determined by linear interpolation between the larger and smaller ratios in direct proportion to the mortar shear strength.
