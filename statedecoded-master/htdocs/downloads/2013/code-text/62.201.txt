IMPORT AND EXPORT OF EARTH MATERIALS – FEES REQUIRED. (§ 62.201)

  IMPORT AND EXPORT OF EARTH MATERIALS – FEES REQUIRED.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 154,185, Eff. 8/25/80.)	(a)	The Department of Public Works
shall require a fee as a condition of a grading permit involving the import or
export of more than one thousand cubic yards of earth materials to or from a
site in the hillside area. The fee shall be based upon the total number of cubic
yards of earth materials to be imported and the miles of public streets to be
traversed within the hillside area, excepting freeways, by a haul vehicle on one
trip in one direction. To such factors a charge determined by the Board for
transportation of one cubic yard per mile shall be applied, with the minimum and
maximum fee to be established by the Board. The fees and charges herein shall be
adopted in the same manner as provided in Section 12.37 I.1. of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code for establishing fees.  (Amended by Ord. No. 165,675, Eff.
5/11/90.)	(b)	The Department of Public Works may also require, as a further
condition of a grading permit, that the applicant pay a fee of $500 for the
preparation of a noise and vibration study in the event such study is needed to
determine whether the applicant’s activity in transporting earth materials in
the manner proposed will endanger the public health, safety or welfare. Upon
payment of said fee and upon request therefor by the Department, the General
Services Department shall prepare such report.
