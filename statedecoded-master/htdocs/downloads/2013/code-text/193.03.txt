ADDITIONAL FEES. (§ 193.03)

  ADDITIONAL FEES.	The fee schedule listed in Section 193.02 may be increased
to cover the costs of meeting additional requirements (e.g., such as additional
environmental monitoring and/or mitigation monitoring, etc.) that may be imposed
upon a facility through the land use permitting, or other project specific
conditions that would require the LEA to expend resources and services in excess
of its normal level enforcement.
