CRITERIA SELECTION. (§ 91.9508)

  CRITERIA SELECTION.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,260, Eff. 8/30/96.)91.9508.1.  Basis for Analysis. 
The building shall be analyzed to determine the displacements caused by inertial
force effects determined in accordance with the dynamic lateral analysis
procedure of Section 91.9509.  The building structural system shall provide a
complete load path for resisting the effects of seismic loading.  The capacity
of all parts of the structural system shall exceed the demand calculated by the
dynamic analysis using the effective stiffnesses determined by a nonlinear
analysis of the elements.	EXCEPTION:  Buildings conforming to the requirements
of Sections 91.9508.4.2 and 91.9508.4.3 may be analyzed using the procedure
specified in Sections 91.9510 and 91.9511, respectively.91.9508.2.  Site
Geology and Soil Characteristics.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07,
Oper. 1/1/08.)  In the absence of a soils investigation, the soil site class
shall be taken as Type D.91.9508.3.  Configuration Requirements.91.9508.3.1. 
General.  Each structure shall be designated as structurally regular or
irregular.91.9508.3.2.  Regular Structures.  Regular structures have no
significant physical discontinuities in plan or vertical configuration or in
their lateral force-resisting systems such as the irregular features described
below.91.9508.3.  Configuration Requirements.91.9508.3.1.  General.  Each
structure shall be designated as structurally regular or
irregular.91.9508.3.2.  Regular Structures.  Regular structures have no
significant physical discontinuities in plan or vertical configuration or in
their lateral force-resisting systems such as the irregular features described
below.91.9508.3.3.  Irregular Structures.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff.
12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)91.9508.3.3.1.  Irregular structures have significant
physical discontinuities in configuration or in their lateral force- resisting
systems.  Irregular features include, but are not limited to, those described
in Tables 12.3-1 and 12.3-2 of ASCE 7.91.9508.3.3.2.  Structures having one or
more of the features listed in Table 12.3-2 of ASCE 7 shall be designated as
having a vertical irregularity.	EXCEPTION:  Where none of the story drift
ratios under equivalent lateral forces is greater than 1.3 times the story drift
ratio of the story above, the structure may be deemed to not have the structural
irregularities of Type 1 or 2 listed in Table 12.3-2 of ASCE 7.  The story
drift for this determination shall be calculated including torsional
effects.91.9508.3.3.3.  Structures having one or more of the features listed in
Table 12.3-1 of ASCE 7 shall be designated as having a plan
irregularity.91.9508.3.3.4.  Irregular structures conforming to the
requirements of LAMC Sections 91.9508.4 and 91.9511 may be considered regular if
the plan and vertical irregularities are removed by the addition of lateral load
resisting systems.91.9508.4.  Selection of Lateral Analysis
Procedure.91.9508.4.1.  General.  Any structure may be analyzed using the
dynamic lateral analysis procedures of Section 91.9509.  The equivalent lateral
force procedure or the simplified analysis may be used for structures conforming
to the requirements on the use of those analyses.91.9508.4.2.  Equivalent
Lateral Force.  The equivalent lateral force procedure of Section 91.9510 may
be used for regular structures or irregular structures having plan irregularity
only of not more than four stories.91.9508.4.3.  Simplified Analysis.  Regular
structures of not more than four stories conforming to the requirements of
Section 91.9511 may be analyzed for a prescribed strength of their systems and
elements.91.9508.5.  Alternative Procedures.91.9508.5.1.  General. 
Alternative lateral analysis procedures using rational analyses based on
well-established principles of mechanics may be used in lieu of those prescribed
in this division when approved by the Superintendent of Building.91.9508.5.2. 
Seismic Isolation.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper.
1/1/08.)  Seismic isolation (using Chapter 17 of ASCE 7, Seismic Design
Requirements For Seismically Isolated Structures), energy dissipation and
damping systems may be used to reduce story drift when approved by the
Superintendent of Building.  The isolated structure shall comply with the drift
requirements of LAMC Section 91.9509.
