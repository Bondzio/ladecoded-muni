  REFUNDS OF DEPARTMENT FEES.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,185, Eff. 7/22/96.)	No claim for refund of Department
fees shall be allowed in whole or in part unless filed with the City Clerk
within 12 months from the date of expiration of the permit/application or of any
extensions granted by the Department or within 12 months from the date of any
Department or Board action in which a valuation, as required by Chapter IX of
the Los Angeles Municipal Code, is lowered pursuant to the provisions of Section
98.0403.1 of this Code. In the case a valuation is lowered, the refund shall be
100% of the difference paid and what should have been paid on all fees.	Insofar

Sections 22.12 and 22.13 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, the language of this
section shall be construed to control and supersede the language of said
sections as to any such conflict.
