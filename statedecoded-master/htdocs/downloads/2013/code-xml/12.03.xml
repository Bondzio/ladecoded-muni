certain terms and words are herewith defined as follows:	ABANDONED AUTOMOBILE.&#xA0;
Any motor vehicle, which when operated upon a highway is required to be
registered by the California Vehicle Code, whose registration has been expired

which is customarily incidental to that of the main building or to the main use
of the land and which is located in the same or a less restrictive zone and on
the same lot with the main building or use. The relationship between the more
restrictive and the less restrictive zones shall be determined by the sequence
of zones set forth in Sec. 12.23 B.1.(c).&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 106,571, Eff.
1/1/56.)	ACCESSORY LIVING QUARTERS.&#xA0; An accessory building used solely as the

incidental to that of the main building or the main use of the land and which is
located in the same zone or a less restrictive zone and on the same lot with a
main building or main use.&#xA0; The relationship between the more restrictive zones
and the less restrictive zones shall be determined by the sequence of zones set
forth in Section 12.23 B. of this Code.	The garaging, maintaining or storage of
any commercial vehicle on private property which exceeds a registered net weight
of 5,600 pounds shall not be considered an accessory use in the &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zones.
The rental, storage, or storage for rental purposes of a commercial vehicle

location constitutes a nuisance or a health or safety hazard, then the keeping
of birds under those circumstance shall not be an accessory use.	For the
purposes of this section, the occasional sale of birds which is incidental to
the keeping of birds as a hobby, does not constitute a commercial use.	Garage

sale is only incidental to the individual&#x2019;s residential occupancy of the
premises; and	1.	The sales are confined to the sale of used items which were
originally received or purchased for use in the household; and	2.	The sales are
restricted to a maximum of five sales events per calendar year as a means of

household; and	3.	The sales are limited to not more than two consecutive days
per event; and	4.	The sales are limited to not more than ten days per calendar
year total; and	5.	The sales are limited to the hours between 9 a.m. and 5
