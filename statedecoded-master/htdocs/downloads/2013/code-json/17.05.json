(Amended by Ord. No. 152,425, Eff. 6\/29\/79.)\n\n\tIt shall be the duty of this committee to recommend to the Commission minimum width and improvement standards for all classes of public and private streets and alleys. The Commission shall adopt such minimum width and improvement standards as it determines are necessary for the safe and adequate movement of traffic, installation of necessary utilities and reasonable and proper access to abutting property.\n\n\tSaid standards shall not, however, be applicable to any street or alley for which the City Council, by ordinance, adopts specific standards.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 146,585, Eff. 11\/11\/74.)\n\n\tB.\tAdoption Of Standards.\u00a0 All such standards adopted by the Commission shall remain in effect for at least one year. A public hearing shall be conducted by the Commission prior to the approval of any change in such standards. No such change will become effective until 180 days after adoption by the Commission.\n\n\tNo change in such standards after the approval of the Tentative Map shall be imposed as a condition to the recording of a Final Map of a subdivision within the prescribed 18 month period. New or changed standards shall not be required to be met as a condition of permitting a one year extension of time if substantial grading operations have been completed before such extension is requested.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 130,871, Eff. 9\/20\/65.)\n\n\tC.\tConformance To General Plan.\u00a0 Each Tentative Map shall be designed in compliance with the zoning applying to the property or approved by the City Council for change or shall be subject to a condition requiring compliance with such zoning prior to the recordation of the final map.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 156,960, Eff. 8\/27\/82.)\n\n\tIn addition, where a Tentative Map involves land for which a General Plan including dwelling unit densities has been adopted by the Council, and said land is also in an \u201cH\u201d Hillside or Mountainous Area established by Article 2 of this chapter, the number of lots on said map shall be limited so that the number of dwelling units permitted by the applicable zoning regulations shall not substantially exceed the dwelling unit densities shown on said plan. (Amended by Ord. No. 149,402, Eff. 4\/18\/77.)\n\n\tEach Tentative Map shall substantially conform to all other elements of the General Plan.\u00a0 In computing the number of dwelling units, only the area being designated for residential use and land that is being dedicated for public uses shall be considered, excepting, however, land set aside for street purposes, or land required to be dedicated for park and recreation purposes pursuant to Ordinance 141,422.\u00a0 However, in the Greater Downtown Housing Incentive Area, the area used for computing the allowable floor area of a residential (including Apartment Hotel or mixed-use) building shall be the lot area including any land to be set aside for street purposes.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 179,076, Eff. 9\/23\/07.)\n\n\tIn Hillside Areas, as defined in Chapter 1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, which are designated in the Minimum Density housing category by the applicable element of the General Plan adopted by the City Council, the dwelling unit density shall not exceed that allowed by the following formula:\u00a0 (Paragraph and following formula Amended by Ord. No. 179,035, Eff. 9\/17\/07.)\n\n\n\n\tWhere :\tD =\tthe maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre allowable, and\n\n\t\t\tS =\tthe average natural slope of the land in percent.\n\n\tWhere the total allowable number of dwelling units per parcel map or tentative tract map calculated under the above formulas results in a number other than a whole number, it shall be rounded to the nearest whole number as follows:\u00a0 where the fractional portion of the total allowable number of dwelling units equals .5 or more, the total number of allowable dwelling units shall be rounded to the next larger whole number; where the fractional portion of the total allowable number of dwelling units equals less than .5, the total number of allowable dwelling units shall be rounded to the next smaller whole number.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 162,144, Eff. 5\/11\/87.)\n\n\tIn no case shall the permitted density be less than 0.05 dwelling units per gross acre.\u00a0 Where the total allowable number of dwelling units per tentative tract map calculated under the above formula results in a number less than one, it shall be rounded up to allow one dwelling unit per tentative tract map.\u00a0 Where previous grading on a site makes it difficult to determine average natural slope using the above formula, the Director of Planning shall determine the average natural slope in a manner to carry out the purpose and intent of this subsection.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 179,035, Eff. 9\/17\/07.)\n\n\tD.\tStreets.\n\n\t1.\tRight of Way and Roadway Widths. All streets and alleys shall be designed to conform with standards adopted by the Commission.\n\n\t2.\tStreet Grades. Grades of all streets shall be as flat as consistent with adequate surface drainage requirements and the approved development of the proposed subdivision. The minimum grade permitted shall be four\u2013tenths of one per cent, except in extremely flat areas where a grade of two\u2013tenths of one per cent may be used. The maximum grade permitted for major and secondary highways shall be six per cent, except where a grade not to exceed ten percent will eliminate excessive curvature, fill or excavation. The maximum grade permitted for collector streets shall be ten per cent and for local streets shall be 15 per cent. Variations from these requirements may be granted by the Advisory Agency upon recommendation by the City Engineer in individual cases in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.11.\n\n\tChanges in grade greater than four\u2013tenths of one per cent shall be connected by vertical curves. The length of vertical curves shall conform to standards for sight distance and riding qualities established by the City Engineer.\n\n\t3.\tFuture Streets.\u00a0 In the event certain streets or alleys in a subdivision are to be reserved for future public use and they have been approved as to location and width, they shall be indicated on the Final Map and offered for dedication as future streets or future alleys. Certificates providing that the City may accept the offer to dedicate such easement at any time shall be shown on the Final Map.\n\n\t4.\tCorner Cut-Off.\u00a0 At all block corners the property line shall be rounded. On all major and secondary highways, the corner shall have a 20\u2013foot radius curve and on all other streets, a 15\u2013foot radius curve; provided, however, that where commercial development is permitted, a diagonal cutoff of 15\u2013feet \u00d7 15\u2013feet in lieu of a 20\u2013foot radius curve and a ten\u2013foot \u00d7 ten\u2013foot cutoff in lieu of a 15\u2013foot radius curve may be used. In industrial zones the curves shall have a minimum radius of at least 40 feet.\n\n\t5.\tCurves \u2013 Horizontal.\u00a0 The center line radii of curves shall be as large as possible, consistent with conditions. All curves shall have sufficient length to avoid the appearance of an angle point. Reversing curves shall be connected by tangents of length approved by the City Engineer as sufficient to safely reverse the unbalanced centrifugal force. In any case, horizontal curves shall have the following minimum center line radii:\n\nMajor and Secondary Highways\t1,000 feet\nCollector Streets\t500 feet\nLocal Streets, Not Hillside\t300 feet\nLocal Streets, Hillside Area\t125 feet\n\n\t6.\tIntersections. Street intersections shall be as near right angle as possible. No jogs shall be allowed in the continuity of a major or secondary highway. Jogs in a minor or local street where crossing major or secondary highways shall be held to a minimum. Multiple intersections of more than four approaches should be avoided. In hillside areas special conditions may be required.\n\n\t7.\tCul-de-sac Streets. Where cul\u2013de\u2013sac streets are approved, they shall be terminated by a turning area conforming to the latest standards approved by the Commission.\n\n\t8.\tGeneral. (Added by Ord. No. 157,811, Eff. 8\/13\/83.) All streets within and\/or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be improved with curbs and gutters, unless not required by the Advisory Agency upon recommendation of the City Engineer.\n\n\tStreets within and\/or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be improved with sidewalks, except that in mountainous, hillside or rural areas, sidewalks may be omitted or may be provided on only one side of the street with the approval of the Advisory Agency.\n\n\tE.\tAlleys.\n\n\t1.\tAlleys shall be not less than 20 feet in width. Alley serving industrial zones shall be 30 feet wide, unless otherwise approved by the Advisory Agency. All dead-end alleys shall be provided with adequate turning areas. Whenever practicable alleys shall be required at the rear of all lots which are in residential zones and which front a major or secondary highway; alleys may also be required at the rear of lots in commercial and industrial zones.\n\n\t2.\tAlley Intersections.\u00a0 Where two alleys intersect, a triangular corner cut-off of not less than ten feet along each alley line shall be provided.\n\n\tF.\tPedestrian Walks.\u00a0 If it is determined by the Advisory Agency that inner-block pedestrian walks are necessary for the public health, safety or welfare, they shall be dedicated to a width of not less than 10 feet.\n\n\tG.\tBlocks.\u00a0 Blocks shall not exceed 1,700 feet in length, except in hilly areas. The number of intersections of local streets with major and secondary highways shall be kept at a minimum.\n\n\tH.\tLot Size.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 141,474, Eff. 2\/27\/71.)\u00a0 Every lot shall have a minimum width and area to comply with the requirements as specified in Article 2 of this chapter for the zone in which the lot is located, provided, however, that every lot located in a \u201cC\u201d Commercial Zone and for which no minimum width is specified in said article shall have a minimum width of 40 feet. All lots in a residential planned development shall comply with the standard residential conditions of Sec. 13.04 of this Code, and the conditions of approval of the development.\n\n\t1.\t(Amended by Ord. No. 142,861, Eff. 2\/4\/72.)\u00a0 When the Advisory Agency determines that traffic access, topography, and drainage conditions will safely allow lot averaging, and when the subdivider has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Advisory Agency in a written report that such averaging is consistent with proper subdivision design, and in addition will produce, one or more of the following benefits: require less grading than would a subdivision of conventional design not utilizing lot averaging; result in improved lot design; or produce other environmental benefits; the Advisory agency may permit the width and area of not more than 20 percent of the lots in a subdivision located in the \u201cH\u201d Hillside or Mountainous Area to be reduced as specified below, provided that the average area of all lots in said subdivision is not less than the following requirements:\n\n[LOT AREA IN SQUARE FEET]\n(Amended by Ord.

No. 146,985, Eff. 4\/11\/75.)\n\n\t2.\tWhere it finds it necessary in order to promote the general welfare, the Advisory Agency may require that lots which are contiguous or nearby to existing lots on the same street may be increased in size so as to be compatible with the size of such existing lots. However, in no case may the Advisory Agency require such lots to contain an area of over 50 per cent more than that required by the applicable provisions of Article 2 of this chapter.\n\n\t3.\tProperty in commercial or industrial ones need not be divided into more than one lot where such property is to be operated as a unit.\n\n\t4.\tEach portion of the lot which is platted so as to be divided by a City or County boundary line shall be given a separate letter or number on the recorded tract map.\n\n\t5.\tThe side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to the streets, or radial to the street on curved streets, except where topography or other conditions make this impracticable.\n\n\t6.\tWhere it finds that there will be no material increase in the dwelling unit density permitted by the zone, and that the public health, safety or welfare and good subdivision design would be promoted by the dedication of public streets to a width in excess of the approved standards provided for in this section, or the dedication of service roads, or the dedication or reservation of land for public parks, public uses or other open areas, the Advisory Agency may permit the required area of one or more of the lots in a subdivision in an RA, RE, or RS Zone to be reduced to the extent of such dedication or reservation. Provided however, that in no event shall such a reduction exceed 15%; and, no lot in a RA-H or RE-H Zone shall be permitted to be reduced below the minimum area specified therefor in Subdivision 1. of this subsection.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 129,693, Eff. 5\/2\/65.)\n\n\t7.\tWhere the Advisory Agency finds the project is consistent with the dwelling unit density permitted by the General Plan, and that the public health, safety or welfare and good subdivision design will be promoted by the preservation of protected trees, the Advisory Agency may permit the required area of one or more of the lots in a subdivision in an \u201cRA,\u201d \u201cRE,\u201d \u201cRS\u201d or \u201cR1&#038;\u2033 Zone to be reduced by an amount sufficient to provide for protected tree preservation in accordance with Section 17.05 R. of this Code.\u00a0 Provided, however, that in no event shall the reduction exceed 50 percent of the required lot area; no \u201cRA\u201d or \u201cRE\u201d lot shall be reduced below 50 feet in width; no \u201cRS\u201d or \u201cR1&#038;\u2033 lot shall be reduced below 40 feet in width; and no lot in a designated \u201cK\u201d Horsekeeping District shall be reduced below 17,500 square feet.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 177,404, Eff. 4\/23\/06.)\n\n\t8.\tNotwithstanding any other provision of this Code, where the Advisory Agency finds that there will be no increase in density and that the density provisions of the General Plan will not be exceeded, it may approve subdivisions in the R2, RD, R3, R4 and R5 zones, meeting the requirements of Section 12.22 C.25. of this Code. The minimum lot area of lots in any such subdivision shall be 2,500 square feet.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 159,532, Eff. 1\/3\/85.)\n\n\t9.\tIn calculating the density of a subdivision proposed to be developed with residences permitted by Sections 12.08.3 B.1. and 12.22 C.25. of this Code, the area contained within public streets shall be deducted from the gross area of the subdivision; however, the area contained within private streets, public alleys and driveways shall not be deducted from the gross area of the subdivision.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 159,532, Eff. 1\/3\/85.)\n\n\t10.\tIn calculating the allowable floor area of a subdivision proposed to be developed as a residential (including Apartment Hotel or mixed use) building in the Greater Downtown Housing Incentive Area, any land required to be dedicated for street purposes shall be included as part of the lot area of the subdivision.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 179,076, Eff. 9\/23\/07.)\n\n\tI.\tEasements.\u00a0 Easements for public utilities, water system, sewers, street lights, storm drains or flood control channels, and slope rights shall be provided wherever determined necessary by the Advisory Agency upon recommendations of the City Engineer.\n\n\tWherever it is determined that future easements are necessary, a certificate shall be placed on the Final Map indicating that the City may accept such easements at any time.\n\n\tJ.\tHillside Areas.\u00a0 Design requirements for subdivisions in hillside areas shall meet the grading standards established by the Board of Public Work and the grading regulations established by Article I, Chapter 9 of this Code. Such requirements may also include providing soil reports prepared by a Registered Civil Engineer specializing in Soil Mechanics and\/or reports on geological investigations.\n\n\tK.\tProblem Areas.\u00a0 Areas designated by resolution of the Board of Public Works as problem areas shall not be subdivided except when approved by the Advisory Agency upon recommendation of the Superintendent of Building and the City Engineer.\n\n\tL.\tGrading Plans.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 142,877, Eff. 2\/24\/ 72.)\u00a0 The Advisory Agency may require a proposed grading plan with the Tentative Map of any subdivision. Upon recommendation of the Superintendent of Building or the City Engineer, or where it appears that cuts and fills will occur in the grading of the property which may be contrary to the objectives of this article, the Advisory Agency shall require the subdivider to submit grading plans for all or part of the tract before action on the Tentative Map will be taken. Any grading plan submitted shall contain thereon a statement of the quantities (in cubic yards) of cut and fill and quantities of export or import material involved. If the amount of earth material to be imported to or exported from a subdivision site is 1,000 cubic yards or more, statements of the following shall also be included: the proposed borrow or disposal site; the proposed haul route; the total gross weight with load of the proposed haul vehicles; as well as other pertinent data which the Advisory Agency may require.\n\n\tFailure to furnish such a grading plan (where necessary to complete the investigation of the Tentative Map within the time specified in the written notice requesting its submission) shall be cause for the disapproval of the Tentative Map unless an extension of the time for acting on said map is mutually agreed upon between the subdivider and the Advisory Agency.\n\n\tIf changes in the design of the lots or street system can be made to correct the conditions set forth in Subsection J. of this section, either by increased lot sizes or changes in grades, such modifications shall be made.\n\n\tM.\tStorm Drains.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 139,199, Eff. 10\/10\/69.)\u00a0 Storm drains shall be designed in conformance with standards approved by the City Engineer. Storm drain facilities to intercept and convey all runoff to a suitable point of disposal shall be required when runoff from the entire area tributary to and including the subdivision exceeds the limiting depth of street flow as determined by the City Engineer. These storm drain requirements shall also include the following:\n\n\t1.\tIn areas without sumps, storm drains shall be designed to remove all runoff from a storm of 10-year frequency.\n\n\t2.\tIn sump areas, storm drains shall be designed to remove all runoff from a storm of 50-year frequency.\n\n\t3.\tStorm drains shall be of sufficient capacity in all cases to prevent flooding of building sites from a storm of 50-year frequency.\n\n\t4.\tOn sidehill streets, the maximum depth of water as determined by the City Engineer shall be based on a storm of 50-year frequency.\n\n\tN.\tInstallation Of Utilities.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 131,820, Eff. 3\/28\/66.)\u00a0 Utility lines, including but not limited to those required for electricity, communication, street lighting and cable television services necessary for the general use of the lot owners in the subdivision, shall be installed or guaranteed to be installed in the same manner as other required improvements.\n\n\tIn all portions of a Tract Map area classified in the A, R or C zones, all such utility lines shall be installed underground, provided, however, that incidental, appurtenant equipment such as transformers, terminal boxes and meter cabinets may be placed above ground but shall conform with regard to placement and height with those standards adopted by the Commission as it determines are necessary to safeguard the public against hazards created by said equipment and to further the purposes of this article. The Subdivision Committee shall make its report and recommendation of the Commission prior to the adoption of said standards.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 146,985, Eff. 4\/11\/75.)\n\n\tThe subdivider shall make the necessary Cost and other arrangements for such underground installation and for relocation of existing facilities with each of the persons, firms, or corporations furnishing utility services involved.\n\n\tO.\tSites for Models.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 172,839, Eff. 11\/1\/99.)\u00a0 Not more than 15% of the lots and in no case more than 20 lots at any one time in a subdivision may be designated as sites for the construction of models, and, with respect to multiple unit structures, not more than 15% of the units and in no case more than 20 units at any one time in a proposed building designated as a model site, may be designated as models.\n\n\tEach of the sites shall be located in a manner as to not adversely affect existing developed residential properties.\u00a0 Further, each of the sites shall be easily accessible and provision for the accessibility shall be assured at the time that the tentative map is conditionally approved.\n\n\tP.\tPark And Recreation Sites.\u00a0 Park and recreation sites to serve the future inhabitants of each new subdivision shall be provided and located in conformance with the standards contained in the Recreation Element of the General Plan.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 141,422, Eff. 2\/11\/71.)\n\n\tQ.\tWhere Subdivision Includes Land Within Drainage District.\u00a0 Whenever a Subdivision or a portion thereof includes land which is within a Local Drainage District, the provisions and requirements of the ordinance establishing such District shall be complied with.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 142,862, Eff. 2\/13\/72.)\n\n\tR.\tProtected Tree Regulations.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 177,404, Eff. 4\/23\/06.)\u00a0 No protected tree may be relocated or removed except as provided in this article or Article 6 of Chapter IV of this Code.\u00a0 The term \u201cremoved\u201d or \u201cremoval\u201d shall include any act that will cause a protected tree to die, including but not limited to acts that inflict damage upon the root system or other parts of the tree by fire, application of toxic substances, operation of equipment or machinery, or by changing the natural grade of land by excavation or filling the drip line area around the trunk.\n\n\t1.\tRequired Determinations.\u00a0 Subject to historical preservation requirements set forth in Subdivision 3. of this subsection, when a protected tree exists within a proposed subdivision, the tree may be relocated or removed if the Advisory Agency, in consultation with the City\u2019s Chief Forester, determines the existence of either (a) or (b) below:\n\n\t(a)\tThere has been prior applicable government action in which:\n\n\t(i)\tThe removal of the tree had been approved by the Advisory Agency; or\n\n\t(ii)\tThe property upon which the protected tree is located has been the subject of a determination by the City Planning Commission, the City Council, a Zoning Administrator, or an Area Planning Commission, the appeal period established by this Code with respect to the determination has expired, the determination is still in effect, and pursuant to the determination, the protected tree\u2019s removal would be permissible; or\n\n\t(iii)\tA building permit has been issued for the property upon which the protected tree is located, the permit is still in effect, and the removal or relocation is not prohibited by the permit.\n\n\t(b)\tThe removal of the protected tree would not result in an undesirable, irreversible soil erosion through diversion or increased flow of surface waters that cannot be mitigated to the satisfaction of the City\u2019s Chief Forester, and the physical condition or location of the tree is such that:\n\n\t(i)\tIts continued presence in its existing location prevents the reasonable development of the property; or\n\n\t(ii)\tAccording to a report required pursuant to Section 17.06 C., acceptable to the Advisory Agency and prepared by a tree expert, there is a substantial decline from a condition of normal health and vigor of the tree, and its restoration through appropriate and economically reasonable preservation procedures and practices is not advisable; or\n\n\t(iii)\tIt is in danger of falling due to an existing and irreversible condition.\n\n\t(iv)\tIts continued presence at its existing location interferes with proposed utility services or roadways within or without the subject property, and the only reasonable alternative to the interference is the removal of the tree;

(Amended by Ord. No. 152,425, Eff. 6\/29\/79.)\tIt shall be the\nduty of this committee to recommend to the Commission minimum width and\nimprovement standards for all classes of public and private streets and alleys.\nThe Commission shall adopt such minimum width and improvement standards as it\ndetermines are necessary for the safe and adequate movement of traffic,\ninstallation of necessary utilities and reasonable and proper access to abutting\nproperty.\tSaid standards shall not, however, be applicable to any street or\nalley for which the City Council, by ordinance, adopts specific standards.\u00a0\n(Added by Ord. No. 146,585, Eff. 11\/11\/74.)\tB.\tAdoption Of Standards.\u00a0 All such\nstandards adopted by the Commission shall remain in effect for at least one\nyear. A public hearing shall be conducted by the Commission prior to the\napproval of any change in such standards. No such change will become effective\nuntil 180 days after adoption by the Commission.\tNo change in such standards\nafter the approval of the Tentative Map shall be imposed as a condition to the\nrecording of a Final Map of a subdivision within the prescribed 18 month period.\nNew or changed standards shall not be required to be met as a condition of\npermitting a one year extension of time if substantial grading operations have\nbeen completed before such extension is requested.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

The maximum grade permitted for major\nand secondary highways shall be six per cent, except where a grade not to exceed\nten percent will eliminate excessive curvature, fill or excavation. The maximum\ngrade permitted for collector streets shall be ten per cent and for local\nstreets shall be 15 per cent. Variations from these requirements may be granted\nby the Advisory Agency upon recommendation by the City Engineer in individual\ncases in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.11.\tChanges in grade\ngreater than four\u2013tenths of one per cent shall be connected by vertical\ncurves. The length of vertical curves shall conform to standards for sight\ndistance and riding qualities established by the City Engineer.\t3.\tFuture\nStreets.\u00a0 In the event certain streets or alleys in a subdivision are to be\nreserved for future public use and they have been approved as to location and\nwidth, they shall be indicated on the Final Map and offered for dedication as\nfuture streets or future alleys. Certificates providing that the City may accept\nthe offer to dedicate such easement at any time shall be shown on the Final\nMap.\t4.\tCorner Cut-Off.\u00a0 At all block corners the property line shall be\nrounded. On all major and secondary highways, the corner shall have a 20\u2013foot\nradius curve and on all other streets, a 15\u2013foot radius curve; provided,\nhowever, that where commercial development is permitted, a diagonal cutoff of\n15\u2013feet \u00d7 15\u2013feet in lieu of a 20\u2013foot radius curve and a ten\u2013foot \u00d7\nten\u2013foot cutoff in lieu of a 15\u2013foot radius curve may be used.
