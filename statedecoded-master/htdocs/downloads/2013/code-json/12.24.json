decision-maker fails to act on an application within 75 days from the date of filing a complete application, or within a mutually agreed upon extension of time, the applicant may file a request for a transfer of jurisdiction to the designated appellate body for decision.\u00a0 The designated appellate body is the body to whom the matter would normally be appealable, pursuant to Subsections U, V, W

to whom the matter has been transferred shall consider the application following the same procedures and subject to the same limitations as are applicable to the initial decision-maker, except that the body to which the matter has been transferred shall act within 45 days of the transfer of jurisdiction.\u00a0 The Department of City Planning, including the Office of Zoning Administration, shall make investigations and furnish any reports requested by the body to which the matter has been transferred.\n\n\tI.\tAppeals.\n\n\t1.\tEffective Date of Initial Decision.\u00a0 An initial decision becomes final and effective upon the close of the 15-day appeal period if not appealed, or as provided in this subsection if appealed.\n\n\t2.\tFiling of an Appeal.\u00a0 An applicant or any other

decision on forms provided by the Department.\u00a0 The appeal shall set forth specifically the points at issue, the reasons for the appeal, and the basis upon which the appellant claims there was an error or abuse of discretion by the initial decision-maker.\u00a0 Any appeal not filed within the 15-day period shall not be considered by the appellate body.\u00a0 The filing of an appeal stays proceedings in the matter until the appellate body has made a decision.\u00a0 Once an appeal is filed, the initial decision-maker shall transmit the appeal and the file to the appellate body, together with any report if one was prepared by staff responding to the allegations made in the appeal.\n\n\t3.\tAppellate Decision \u2013 Public Hearing and Notice.\u00a0 Before acting on any appeal, the appellate body shall set the matter for hearing, giving the same notice as provided for the original hearing.\u00a0 When considering an appeal from the decision of an initial decision-maker, the

body shall act within 75 days after the expiration of the appeal period or within any additional period mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the appellate body.\u00a0 The failure of the appellate body to adopt a resolution within this time period shall be deemed a denial of the appeal.\n\n\t5.\tAppellate Decision.\u00a0 The appellate body may, by resolution, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, any decision of the initial decision-maker.\u00a0 If the City Council is the appellate body, the resolution to reverse or modify, in whole or in part, shall only be adopted by at least a

the record.\n\n\t6.\tProcedures and Effective Date of Appellate Decision.\n\n\t(a)\tWhen a conditional use decision is appealed to the City Council and the Council either approves the conditional use or denies an appeal from an earlier approval, the matter together with the files and reports shall forthwith be transmitted to the Mayor.\u00a0 The Mayor may approve or disapprove the conditional use within ten days of its presentation to him or her.\u00a0 This action shall be based solely upon the administrative record and whether the Mayor believes the conditional use conforms with the requirements for approval set forth in this section.\u00a0 If the Mayor disapproves the conditional use, he or she shall return the matter to the City Clerk for presentation to the Council, together with the objections in writing.\u00a0 The Council within 60 days after the matter has been returned to it may override the disapproval:\n\n\t(i)\tby a two-thirds vote if the Council had not modified the conditional use as approved by the initial decision-maker, or if the Council had made the initial approval of the conditional use by reason of the failure of the initial decision-maker to act; or\n\n\t(ii)\tby a three-fourths vote if the Council had modified and approved the conditional use or reversed the action of the initial decision-maker and had approved the conditional use.\n\n\tIf the Council fails to override the Mayor\u2019s disapproval within the 60 days, the Mayor\u2019s disapproval shall constitute a denial of the conditional use.\u00a0 If the Mayor fails to return the matter to the City Clerk within ten days of its presentation to him or her, the approval of the conditional use shall become final.\n\n\t(b)\tWhen a conditional use decision of the Zoning Administrator is appealed to an Area Planning Commission, the appellate decision of the Area Planning Commission shall be final and effective as provided in Charter Section 245.\n\n\tJ.\t(Deleted by

Further, the conditions included in any special district ordinance, exception or variance which authorized the use shall also continue in effect.\n\n\tAny lot or portion of a lot in the C2, C3, C4, CM or M1 Zones which was being used on June 1, 1951, for the temporary storage of abandoned, dismantled, partially dismantled, obsolete or wrecked automobiles, but not for the dismantling or wrecking of automobiles nor for the storage or sale of used parts, may continue to be so used.\n\n\tRegulations governing yards, accessory buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks shall conform to the provisions of Title 25 of the California Administrative Code or any amendments.\u00a0 If yards, accessory buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks are not regulated by Title 25, they shall conform to all applicable provisions of this Code or any other conditions imposed by the City.\n\n\tAny CM uses lawfully existing prior to March 22, 1981, in any portion of any building in the C5 Zone shall not be extended beyond that portion of the building except as provided by Section 12.24W of this Code.\n\n\tM.\tDevelopment of Uses.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 173,992, Eff. 7\/6\/01.)\n\n\t1.\tDevelopment of Site.\u00a0 On any lot or portion of a lot on which a deemed- approved conditional use is permitted pursuant to the provisions of this section, new buildings or structures may be erected, enlargements may be made to existing buildings, and existing uses may be extended on an approved site, as permitted in Subsection L of this section, provided that plans are submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission, whichever has jurisdiction at the time. The Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission may deny the plans if the Zoning Administrator or the Commission finds that the use does not conform to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a conditional use under this section, and may specify the conditions under which the plans may be approved.\n\n\tThe Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission may delegate to the Director of Planning the authority to approve or disapprove, on their behalf, plans for the development of an approved or deemed-approved conditional use site.\u00a0 The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission shall establish reasonable guidelines and policies to be followed in the exercise of the delegated authority.\n\n\tEXCEPTIONS:\n\n\tA plan approval shall not be required in the following instances:\n\n\t(a)\tFor buildings within mobilehome parks located in the M2 Zone, which existed in that zone on September 3, 1961, provided that the entire approval site is retained for mobilehome park use and there is no increase in the number of mobilehome sites.\n\n\t(b)\tFor temporary structures erected on the site of a place of worship in an A Zone, if:\n\n\t(1)\tthe structures are erected and maintained not more than five days in any one year;\n\n\t(2)\tall structures, including temporary facilities, are located at least 40 feet from all exterior lot lines;\n\n\t(3)\tthe required permits are obtained from the Fire Department, and all structures are removed from the premises the next day following the closing of the event;\n\n\t(4)\tno public address system in connection with the event is installed on the property unless it is modulated so as not to be disturbing to occupants of nearby dwelling units; and\n\n\t(5)\tany lights used to illuminate the area are arranged to reflect the light away from any adjacent residentially used premises.\n\n\t2.\tAppeal.\u00a0 An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may appeal the decision to the Area Planning Commission pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.\u00a0 An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may appeal the decision to the City Council pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.\n\n\tN.\tReduction of Site. \u00a0 So long as the conditional use is continued, the entire approved site shall be retained for the conditional use, and no portion shall be severed from the site or utilized for other purposes unless the plans for the reduced site are first submitted to and approved by the initial decision-maker.\n\n\tThe decision of an initial decision-maker on a proposed reduction of the area of an approved site shall be subject to the same appeal procedures as is provided for an application to establish the conditional use.\n\n\tO.\tFindings and Conditions of Approval.\u00a0 In approving any conditional use plans, the initial decision-maker must find that the use conforms to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a conditional use under this section and may impose conditions on the same basis as provided for in this section for the establishment of new conditional uses.\u00a0 The initial decision-maker shall adopt written findings of fact supporting the decision based upon evidence in the record, including any investigations.\n\n\tP.\tChange of Use.\u00a0 No conditional use may be changed to a different type of conditional use unless the new use is authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.\n\n\tQ.\tDiscontinuance of Use.\u00a0 If a conditional use is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not be re-established unless authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.\n\n\tR.\tPlanned Residential Developments or Housing Projects Approved as Conditional Uses.\u00a0 No provision of Section 13.04 of this Code shall be construed as limiting or modifying the provisions of any conditional use approval, or any other right already existing, for a housing project or planned residential development granted prior to the effective date of that section.\u00a0 The provisions of this section shall continue to apply to those developments, and the Commission is authorized to perform all required administrative acts.\u00a0 Provided, however, if a conditional use for a housing project or planned residential development approved prior to the effective date of Section 13.04 is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be re-established unless authorized as a Residential Planned Development Supplemental Use District.\u00a0 The planned residential development shall not be divided or separated in ownership unless authorized under supplemental use district procedures as a residential planned development.\n\n\tS.\tAs part of any conditional use approval, the initial decision-maker or the appellate body may approve changes to the parking requirements not to exceed 20% of the requirements otherwise required by the Code.\n\n\tT.\tVesting Conditional Use Applications.\n\n\t1.\tApplication.\u00a0 Whenever a provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code requires the filing of an application for a conditional use permit, a vesting conditional use permit may be filed instead, in accordance with these provisions.\u00a0 If an applicant does not seek the rights conferred by this subsection, the filing of a vesting application shall not be required by the City for the approval of any proposed zone change, conditional use permit, permit for construction or work preparatory to construction.\n\n\t2.\tDevelopment Rights.\n\n\t(a)\tThe approval of a vesting application shall confer a vested right to proceed with a development in substantial compliance with the rules, regulations, ordinances, zones and officially adopted policies of the City of Los Angeles in force on the date the application is deemed complete, and with the conditions of approval imposed and specifically enumerated by the decision maker in its action on the vesting application case.\u00a0 These rights shall not include exemption from other applications or approvals that may be necessary to entitle a project to proceed (i.e., subdivision, parcel map, zone variance, design review, etc.) and from subsequent changes in the Building and Safety and Fire regulations contained in Chapters V and IX of the Los Angeles Municipal Code found necessary by the City Council to protect the public health and safety and which are applicable on a citywide basis and policies and standards relating to those regulations or from citywide programs enacted after the application is deemed complete to implement State or Federal mandates.\n\n\t(b)\tIf the ordinances, policies, or standards described in the preceding paragraph are changed subsequent to the approval or conditional approval of a vesting application case, the applicant, or his or her successor or assignee, at any time prior to the expiration of the vesting application case, may apply, pursuant to Subdivision 4 of this subsection, for an amendment to the vesting application case to secure a vested right to proceed with the changed ordinances, policies, or standards.\u00a0 An application shall clearly specify the changed ordinances, policies, or standards for which the amendment is sought.\n\n\t(c)\tPrior to final approval or signoff on a building permit filed pursuant to a vesting application, the Planning Department shall submit a copy of the final site plan to the office of the affected council district for informational purposes only.\n\n\t3.\tProcedures.\n\n\t(a)\tFiling and Processing an Application.\u00a0 A vesting conditional use permit application shall be filed on the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in Subsections B through Q for a conditional use permit except as provided below.\u00a0 The application shall specify that the case is for a vesting conditional use permit.\u00a0 If any rules, regulations or ordinances in force at the time of filing require any additional approvals (such as a variance or coastal development permit), the complete application for these additional approvals shall be filed prior to or simultaneously with the vesting conditional use permit to be processed pursuant to Section 12.36.\u00a0 In all vesting conditional use permit cases, a site plan and a rendering of the architectural plan of the building envelope shall be submitted with the application.\u00a0 The plans and renderings shall show the proposed project\u2019s height, design, size and square footage, number of units, the location of buildings, driveways, internal vehicular circulation patterns, loading areas and docks, location of landscaped areas, walls and fences, pedestrian and vehicular entrances, location of public rights-of-way and any other information deemed necessary by the Director of Planning.\n\n\t(b)\t(Amended by Ord.

and\u00a0\n\n\t(ii)\tThat the Building or Structure will not be materially detrimental or injurious to the adjacent property or improvements; and\n\n\t(iii)\tThat the Building or Structure will not have a materially adverse safety impact on the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n\t(iv)\tThat the site and\/or existing improvements make strict adherence to Paragraph (i) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code impractical or infeasible.\n\n\t(c)\tProcedures.\u00a0 An application pursuant to this Subdivision 28. shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 12.28 C.1., 2. and 3. of this Code.\u00a0 Except that public hearings for fences, walls, and retaining walls within required yards may not be required if the applicant submits with the application the written approval of the owners of all properties abutting, across the Street or alley from, or having a common corner with the subject property.\n\n\t(1)\tImport\/Export (Haul Route) Review.\u00a0 Upon filing an application pursuant to this Subdivision 28. for the import or export of earth materials pursuant to the authority granted in Subparagraph (5) of Paragraph (a) of this Subdivision, the Zoning Administrator shall request that the General Manager of the Department of Transportation investigate the circumstances of the proposed import or export of earth materials and the effect thereof upon the public health, safety, and welfare.\u00a0 The Zoning Administrator shall request the City Engineer to determine the effect of any import or export on the structural integrity of the public Streets and to determine the effect on public safety relative to Street alignment, width, and Grade.\n\n\tIn taking action on such Zoning Administrator Determination, the Zoning Administrator shall impose conditions of approval to mitigate any detrimental effects of the hauling operations necessary to import or export earth, including but not limited to: limiting truck weight, length and\/or speed; and other conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure repair of damages to public Streets along the hauling route that may reasonably be expected to be caused by hauling operations.\u00a0 Such additional conditions may include a condition that the developer shall file a bond for the benefit of the City.\u00a0 Any such bond shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney, executed by the developer and a corporate surety authorized to do business in the State in an amount sufficient to cover the repair of any damage to the public Streets reasonably expected to be caused by the hauling operations.\u00a0 The conditions of the bond shall guarantee to indemnify the City for all costs and expense in repairing the damaged Streets or other public facilities.\u00a0 In lieu of a surety bond, the developer may file a cash bond with the Department upon the same terms and conditions and in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond.\u00a0 The deposit submitted may be in the form of cash or negotiable United States securities.\u00a0 The term of such effect until the completion of the hauling operations and subsequent inspection of the affected public Streets by the Department of Public Works.\n\n\t(d)\tConditions for Approval.\u00a0 In approving the uses and activities authorized in this Subdivision, the Zoning Administrator may impose those conditions he or she deems necessary to remedy a disparity of privileges and that are necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare and assure compliance with the objectives of the General Plan and the purpose and intent of the zoning.\n\n\t29.\tHistorical Vehicle Collection.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5\/7\/12.)\u00a0 A Zoning Administrator may allow the maintenance of a Historic Vehicle Collection as an accessory use.\u00a0 In addition to the findings set forth in Section 12.24 E., the Zoning Administrator shall find:\n\n\t(a)\tthat all the historic vehicles and parts maintained in outdoor storage, whether currently licensed or unlicensed, or whether operable or inoperable constitute an Historic Vehicle Collection;\n\n\t(b)\tthe Historic Vehicle Collection occupies less than 50 percent of the area of the lot for lots comprising 10,000 square feet or less, or 70 percent of the area of the lot for lots comprising more than 10,000 square feet.\n\n\t(c)\tthe Historic Vehicle Collection is fully screened from ordinary public view by means of a suitable fence, trees, shrubbery, opaque covering or other appropriate means;\n\n\t(d)\tno portion of the Historic Vehicle Collection is located within five feet of any building or within any side yards required by this Code; and\n\n\t(e)\tplans for the maintenance of the Historic Vehicle Collection have been submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the procedures in Section 12.28 C.1., 2. and 3. and subject to the same fees as in Section 19.01 E. for relief from fence height limitation.\n\n\t30.\tReduced Parking in a Modified Parking Requirement (MPR) District.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 182,242, Eff. 10\/9\/12.)\u00a0 A Zoning Administrator may, upon application, reduce the number of off-street parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. of this Code, provided that the project is located within a Modified Parking Requirement (MPR) District established through the application of Section 13.15 of this Code, and provided further that the MPR District authorizes the Zoning Administrator to reduce the number of off-street parking spaces.\n\n\tY.\tSpecial Permission for Reduction of Off-Street Parking Spaces by the Director.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10\/10\/00.)\u00a0 A reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. may be permitted by the Director as the initial decision-maker or by the Area Planning Commission as the appellate body.\u00a0 The procedures for decisions on these uses shall be the same as those for variances as provided in Section 12.27 B. in addition to those set out below, except that the initial decision-maker shall be the Director, there is only one level of appeal and the findings necessary to grant the reduction shall be that the action is in conformity with the public necessity, convenience, general welfare and good zoning practice and that the action will be in substantial conformance with the various elements and objectives of the General Plan.\n\n\tIf the Director finds that a commercial or industrial building is located on a lot not more than 1,500 feet distant from the portal of a fixed rail transit station, or bus station, or other similar transit facility, then the required number of parking spaces for that commercial or industrial building shall be decreased by ten percent of the number otherwise required by Section 12.21 A.4.(c).\u00a0 If the Director makes this finding, then no more than 90 percent of the parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4.(c) of this subdivision are required to be provided on the lot.\u00a0 The 1,500-foot distance shall be measured as specified in Section 12.21 A.4.(g).\u00a0 A portal shall be defined as the street-level entrance, exit or escalator of a transit station.\n\n\tA station may be used as the basis of a reduction if the Director decides that it is currently in use; that a full funding contract for a proposed station\u2019s location and portals have been signed by all funding partners; or that a resolution to fund a preferred alignment has been adopted by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission by a resolution detailing specific stations and portal locations.\u00a0 Before approving a parking reduction application filed pursuant to this subdivision, a Director shall find that the surrounding area will not be adversely affected by overflow parking or traffic congestion originating or terminating at the lot, and that the reduction will not otherwise be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the properties or improvements in the surrounding area.\n\n\tIn the following cases, an application pursuant to this subsection shall be set for public hearing and notice shall be given pursuant to Section 12.27 C.:\n\n\t(i)\twhen it can reasonably be anticipated that approval of the application could have a significant adverse effect on adjoining properties or on the immediate neighborhood; or\n\n\t(ii)\twhen the application is likely to evoke public controversy.\u00a0 In all other cases an application pursuant to this subdivision need not be set for public hearing, unless the Director determines that a hearing would further the public interest.\n\n\tA copy of each application shall be promptly submitted to the Councilmember of the district in which the property is located.\n\n\tZ.\tRevocation.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10\/10\/00.)\u00a0 If the conditions of any conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approvals granted pursuant to this section have not been complied with, the Director, or the City Planning Commission if the approval or conditional use was granted by the City Planning Commission, upon knowledge of the fact of non-compliance, may give notice to the record owner or lessee of the real property affected to appear at a time and place fixed by the City Planning Commission or Director and show cause why the decision granting the approval or conditional use should not be repealed or rescinded, as the case may be.\u00a0 The City Planning Commission may delegate its authority in this matter to the Director.\u00a0 After the hearing, the City Planning Commission or the Director may revoke the conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval.\u00a0 An appeal from this revocation action may be taken to the City Council in the same manner prescribed in Subsection I.\u00a0 The City Council\u2019s decision on appeal shall be reviewable as an approval of a conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval in the manner prescribed in Subsection I.6.\n\n\tAfter revocation, the property affected shall be subject to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as provided in this article.\n\n\tAA.\tAdditional Revocation Authority.\u00a0 The Director may require the modification, discontinuance, or revocation of any conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval granted in accordance with the procedure in this section in the manner prescribed in Section 12.27.1.\u00a0 In the event of a revocation, the property affected by the revocation shall be subject to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as provided in this article.","order_by":"24","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"20","name":"Specific Planning \u2013 Zoning\nComprehensive Zoning

disapproves the conditional use, he or she shall return the matter to the City Clerk for presentation to the Council, together with the objections in writing.\u00a0 The Council within 60 days after the matter has been returned to it may override the disapproval:\t(i)\tby a two-thirds vote if the Council had not modified the conditional use as approved by the initial decision-maker, or if the

the conditional use or reversed the action of the initial decision-maker and had approved the conditional use.\tIf the Council fails to override the Mayor\u2019s disapproval within the 60 days, the

The Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission may deny the plans if the Zoning Administrator or the Commission finds that the use does not conform to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a conditional use under this section, and may specify the conditions under which the plans may be approved.\tThe Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission may delegate to the Director of Planning the authority to approve or disapprove, on their behalf, plans for the development of an approved or deemed-approved conditional use site.\u00a0 The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission shall establish reasonable guidelines and policies to be followed in the exercise of the delegated authority.\tEXCEPTIONS:\tA

site shall be retained for the conditional use, and no portion shall be severed from the site or utilized for other purposes unless the plans for the reduced site are first submitted to and approved by the initial decision-maker.\tThe decision of an initial decision-maker on a proposed reduction of the area of an approved site shall be subject to the same appeal procedures as is provided for an application to establish the conditional use.\tO.\tFindings and Conditions of Approval.\u00a0 In approving any conditional use plans, the initial decision-maker must find that the use conforms to the

accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.\tR.\tPlanned Residential Developments or Housing Projects Approved as Conditional Uses.\u00a0 No provision of Section 13.04 of this Code shall be construed as limiting or modifying the provisions of any conditional use approval, or any other right already existing, for a housing project or planned residential development granted prior to the effective date of that section.\u00a0 The provisions of this section shall continue to apply to those developments, and the Commission is authorized to perform all required administrative acts.\u00a0 Provided, however, if a conditional use for a housing project or planned residential development approved prior to the effective date of Section 13.04 is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be re-established unless authorized as a Residential Planned Development Supplemental Use District.\u00a0 The planned residential development shall not be divided or separated in ownership unless authorized under supplemental use district procedures as a residential planned
