&#xA0; DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
	(Article and Section Added by Ord. No. 171,884, Eff. 2/6/98.)

	Many Los Angeles City tenants reside in master-metered apartment buildings and
pay for essential utility service through their rent payment to the landlord.&#xA0;
The landlord has the financial obligation to pay the Department of Water and
Power for utility services.

	A crisis now exists in the City.&#xA0; There are approximately 11,000
master-metered apartment buildings whose owners have failed to pay for utility
services.&#xA0; Tenants who pay rent which include the cost of utilities face
utility service termination due to the diversion of funds by the owners.&#xA0; The
termination of utility service to a master-metered apartment building would make
the building uninhabitable pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1941.1 et
seq.

	The purpose of this ordinance is to offer tenants an alternative to service
termination in master-metered apartment buildings.&#xA0; Tenants who participate in
the Utility Maintenance Program (UMP) have the option of paying their rent into
an escrow account to maintain their utility services.&#xA0; The UMP is built on the
existing Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP).
