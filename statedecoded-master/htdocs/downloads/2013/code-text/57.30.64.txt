  STATIC ELECTRICITY.	A.	Where containers are not effectively grounded and
bonded by contact or connection, provisions shall be made to prevent the
accumulation of static electrical charges which may create a source of ignition
in the presence of flammable vapors or gases.	B.	Bonding devices which are
temporarily clamped, clipped, or otherwise attached to movable equipment shall
have a conductor of ample length to assure the effective attachment of the
device. This conductor shall be stranded wire not smaller than No. 8, A.W.G.
(America Wire Gage).	C.	When attaching bonding clamps or clips, a secure and
positive metal-to-metal contact shall be made. Such attachments shall be made
before closures are opened and liquid movements are started and shall not be
broken until after liquid movements are stopped and closures are made.
