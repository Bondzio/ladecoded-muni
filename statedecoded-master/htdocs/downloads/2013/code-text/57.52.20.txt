ZIRCONIUM.	A.	Nonflammable, water soluble coolants shall be used for wet

continuous basis, and filter cake shall be removed daily to a safe storage area
or disposed of following applicable regulations.	B.	Dust shall be collected by
means of suitable hoods or enclosures at each dust-producing operation.  The
hoods or enclosures shall be connected to liquid precipitation separation, and

systems shall be fabricated and installed according to L.A.F.D. Standard No. 42
and Division 53 of this article.	C.	Pans:  Wherever practicable, machines shall
be provided with a pan to intercept chips, turnings or fines.  The pan shall be

extinguishing powder.
