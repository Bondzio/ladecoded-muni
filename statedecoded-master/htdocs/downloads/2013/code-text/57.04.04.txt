SEPARATE PERMITS REQUIRED. (§ 57.04.04)

  SEPARATE PERMITS REQUIRED.	A.	A Permit issued under the provisions of this
division shall be valid only for the person in whose name it is issued, and for
the location shown on the Permit. Separate locations require separate
Permits.	B.	When the distance between oil wells is reduced, as provided in
Section 57.90.01 J of this article, then additional cellars may be constructed
and conductor pipes not more than 100 feet deep may be set before obtaining the
Permit for the oil well approved under that  section; provided however, there
shall be one valid Permit in effect for one oil well at the same drill site, and
the bond required by Section 57.04.14 of this article shall state that said bond
is applicable to all cellars and conductor pipes that may have been constructed
on the same drill site and for which a separate oil well permit has not been
granted.
