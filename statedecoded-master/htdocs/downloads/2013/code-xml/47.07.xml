affirmative defense the failure of the landlord to comply with Subsection D of
this section. In addition, any landlord who fails to provide monetary relocation
assistance to a tenant as required by this section shall be liable in a civil
action to the tenant to whom such assistance is due for damages in the amount
the landlord has failed to pay, together with reasonable attorney&#x2019;s fees and
costs as determined by the court. (Amended by Ord. No. 155,397, Eff. 8/2/81;
