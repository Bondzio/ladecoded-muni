No. 150,478, Eff. 2\/6\/78.)\n\n\t(a)\tRestricted Area.\u00a0 The area in a street between the face of an existing or future curb and four feet back of such curb face is reserved for use by the Department of Public Works. Installation of facilities within, or other use of, this area will not be permitted except as provided herein. The Board may issue permits as provided in Section 62.02 for installations in or use of this area. Such permits are subject to revocation by the Board at any time it becomes necessary to construct a public work of any kind within the area.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 Restriction on the use of such area will not apply to service connections, meters, pole installations, or City-owned facilities used for governmental purposes. However, the installation of poles may not be permitted, or poles being maintained in street areas may be ordered removed, when territory adjacent to such street is provided with a public alley or with an easement or private right of way specifically set aside for the purpose of erecting poles therein.\n\n\tPoles which are erected and maintained in streets shall be set as close as practicable to the back of the curb unless some other point is approved or designated by the Board.\n\n\t(b)\tDepth of Substructure Installations.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 150,478, Eff. 2\/6\/78.)\u00a0 All service pipes, main line pipes, conduits, ducts, tunnels, or other structures, except manholes and vaults, shall be installed in a manner so that all parts thereof located: \u00a0\n\n\t(1)\tin a roadway or alley are at a depth of at least 24 inches below the established grade of the gutter of such roadway or alley; \u00a0\n\n\t(2)\tin the roadway of a major or secondary highway are at a depth of at least 30 inches below such grade;\u00a0\n\n\t(3)\tin an area back of an existing or proposed curb in any public street, place or easement are at a depth of at least 16 inches below the surface.\n\n\tNotwithstanding the above requirements, any such new or relocated installation intended to carry unstable substances shall be constructed at a depth of at least 42 inches below the established grade of the gutter of such roadway or alley.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 If, by reason of the existence of other installations or the proposed construction of any public work, a proposed installation cannot be made below the minimum depths stated above, the Board may, upon presentation of evidence of the necessity therefor or because of the public benefit to accrue therefrom, grant a permit for an installation at a lesser depth.\n\n\t(c)\tTanks.\n\n\t1.\tPermits Required.\u00a0 No person shall install any storage tank in any public street without obtaining a permit from the Board to do so in compliance with the provisions of Section 62.02.\n\n\tThe issuance of a permit by the Board to excavate in a public street for the purpose of installing an underground storage tank in no way relieves such permittee of the necessity of obtaining an additional permit for such installation from the Fire Department and complying with all applicable provisions of Article 7 of Chapter 5 of this Code.\n\n\t2.\tAgreement to Remove.\u00a0 Permission to maintain a tank in a public street may be revoked by the Board at any time, and upon such revocation, the tank shall be removed. As a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit to install such a tank in a public street, the applicant shall record with the County Recorder of the County of Los Angeles an agreement, approved as to form by the City Attorney, holding the City harmless from any claims arising out of the use of such tank, and setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the owner of the adjacent property to remove the tank without expense to the City when so ordered by the Board. Such agreement shall be a covenant running with the land and binding upon the owner and his successors, heirs and assigns.\n\n\t3.\tAbandonment of Tanks in Place.\u00a0 When not contrary to the public health, safety or welfare, the Board may allow the installation to be only partially removed, and the balance to be abandoned in place, or may permit an unused tank to be filled as provided in Article 7 of Chapter 5 of this Code, and to be abandoned in place.\n\n\t4.\tBoard May Remove or Abandon Tanks.\u00a0 If within 20 days after service by the Board of a notice to remove or fill an underground storage tank, the owner or his heirs, successors, or assigns as the case may be, fails, refuses, or neglects to remove or fill such tank, as directed by the Board, the Board may perform the necessary work and recover the cost of the work from such person.\n\n\t5.\tMaximum Capacity of Tanks.\u00a0 The maximum capacity of any storage tank that may be installed in a public street is 4000 gallons.\n\n\t(d)\tTunnels.\n\n\t1.\tRights of Franchise Holders.\u00a0 No tunnel structure shall be constructed in any location or any manner which will prevent the lawful use or occupation of a street by persons occupying it under the authority of lawfully existing franchises.\n\n\t2.\tInspection of Tunnels.\u00a0 Every tunnel structure constructed shall be subject to inspection at all times by the City Engineer and the Board.\n\n\t3.\tRevocation of Permission to Maintain Tunnels.\u00a0 Permission granted for the construction of a tunnel structure in a public street may be revoked by the Board at any time; and the City reserves the right to resume possession of any portion of any street occupied by a tunnel structure at any time the Council determines that such is necessary or advantageous to the use of the street by the City.\n\n\t4.\tInstallation of Machinery in Tunnels.\u00a0 Machinery, boilers, or engines shall not be placed in any tunnel structure constructed under the surface of any street except that, subject to the approval of Council, conveyor systems may be installed within such tunnel structures.\n\n\t(e)\tLocation Maps and Plans.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 150,478, Eff. 2\/6\/78.)\u00a0 The person owning, using, controlling or having an interest in any subsurface installation, other than a service connection, in any public street shall file with the City Engineer within 60 days after the completing of such installation, a corrected set of maps or atlas sheets showing the installation. Such map shall be drawn to a scale of not more than 200 feet to the inch.\n\n\tIn the event such subsurface installation is for the purpose of carrying an unstable substance, as-built plans and profiles, showing the location, depth and size of the completed installation, in a manner acceptable to the City Engineer, shall also be submitted within said 60-day period.\n\n\tWhenever such subsurface installation in a public street or sidewalk is abandoned or the use thereof is discontinued, the person owning, using, controlling or having an interest therein shall, within 60 days after such abandonment, file with the City Engineer a map showing in detail the location of the abandoned installation.","order_by":"03","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"36","name":"Streets And

Such permits are subject to revocation by the Board at any time it becomes necessary to construct a public work of any kind within the area.\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 Restriction on the use of such area will not apply to service connections, meters, pole installations, or City-owned facilities used for governmental purposes. However, the installation of poles may not be permitted, or poles being maintained in street areas may be ordered removed, when territory adjacent to such street is provided with a public alley or with an easement or private right of way specifically set aside for the purpose of erecting poles therein.\tPoles which are erected and maintained in streets shall be set as close as practicable to the back of the curb unless some other point is approved or designated by the Board.\t(b)\tDepth of Substructure Installations.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.
