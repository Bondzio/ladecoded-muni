Districts, which have a standard streetscape color, to allow for a uniform newsrack color from a limited palate of colors in order to coordinate the color of newsracks with their streetscape.\n\n\t(3)\tCompliance Phase In:\n\n\t(A)\tThe provisions of this subdivision shall apply to all newsracks, whether installed and maintained prior to or after the effective date of this ordinance which in whole or in part rests upon, in, or over any dedicated sidewalk, right-of-way or parkway.\u00a0 Those newsracks installed prior to the effective date of this revised ordinance shall be brought into compliance with the all provisions of this code, except uniform color, as this revised ordinance is implemented by Street Services, area by area, within the City.\u00a0 In no event shall compliance be later than 12 months after the effective date hereof, except that, if the City\u2019s implementation schedule takes longer than 12 months, then compliance by the publishers shall

legally places its newsracks as required by the City\u2019s implementation schedule, then compliance with the uniform color requirement must be accomplished no later than 24 months after the effective date of this ordinance.\u00a0 However, Publishers experiencing financial hardship, solely due to compliance with LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f) as it applies to uniform color, may request the Board to approve one 12-month extension allowing them a total of 36 months to come into full compliance with the uniform color requirement of the Newsrack Ordinance, if evidence of financial hardship is proven to the satisfaction of the Board.\u00a0 Any newsrack not brought into compliance within the aforementioned time period shall be deemed to be in violation of LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f).\n\n\t(4)\tPermit

below, and the application is accompanied by the appropriate permit fee for the type of newsrack, single, pedestal, or modular, for each individual newsrack installation requested.\u00a0 Any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this code shall only be valid as to the specific location specified in the permit application.\u00a0 Where application is made for the installation of two or more single newsracks, a separate permit shall be required for each individual newsrack.\u00a0 Upon this revised ordinance taking legal effect in the City of Los Angeles, any owner of a newsrack currently existing on any City right-of-way must apply for a permit pursuant to this ordinance within the time specified by the Board of Public Works in its Rules and Regulations for the implementation of this ordinance.\u00a0 Any newsrack which is not the subject of a valid permit application as required by the City\u2019s implementation Rules and Regulations will be deemed to be in violation of 42.00 (f)

manufactured for this purpose.\n\n\t(5)\tType or brand of newsrack, including an illustration and description of the newsrack and mount, if other than a single pedestal, size of base plate and whether the newsrack will have a coin-box attachment, or equivalent.\n\n\t(6)\tA sworn statement under penalty of perjury, executed by an officer, director, or authorized agent of the applicant, agreeing that the applicant shall not sell, assign, or transfer by any method, the permit for the newsrack location to any other publisher, distributor, entity or individual.\n\n\t(7)\tThe Board, with Council approval, may designate areas of the City where only modular newsracks may be installed and maintained by a City vendor such as the City Hall Historical District, (the east block face on Spring Street between Temple Street and 1st Street, the south block face of Temple Street between Spring Street and Main Street, the west block face of Main Street between Temple Street and 1st Street, and the north block face of 1st Street between Spring Street and Main Street).\u00a0 No application for an individual newsrack permit may be submitted in a modular newsrack area. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, the total number of compartments in modular newsracks in any designated modular newsrack area, shall be substantially equivalent to the highest total number of individual newsracks known to have been legally maintained on the public right-of-way in the modular newsrack areas at any one time during the year preceding the introduction of this amended ordinance but in no event more than the total number of newsracks allowed by subparagraph (F)(4) below.\n\n\t(8)\tSuch other information as, from time to time, may be required by the

placement of the said rack at the subject location.\n\n\t(C)\tFees.\u00a0 The Board shall establish all fees, in accordance with the level of enforcement deemed appropriate by the Council, and shall only be used to defray the total expenses of operation of the newsrack program including: permitting, inspection, administration, and enforcement, required by this Ordinance as set forth in the preceding and following sections of this code.\u00a0 The Initial Permit Fee, the Renewal Permit Fee, the Site Inspection Fee, the Site Re-Inspection Fee, Late Renewal Penalty Fee, Impound Fees, and

its original amount by the permittee at permittee\u2019s expense at all times during the period for which the permittee holds a valid permit or permits.\u00a0 Should said policy be called upon to satisfy any liability for damages covered by said policy, the policy must be of such a nature that the original amount of coverage is restored after any payment of damages by the policy.\u00a0 In the event that two or more permits are issued to one permittee, the permittee shall only be required to maintain a single policy of insurance covering all such permits held by the permittee in the amount set forth below for the number of newsracks maintained by the permittee.\n\n\t(2)\tRequired Limits of Liability Insurance.\u00a0 The Board shall be responsible, from time to time, for adopting the limits of liability insurance required to be maintained by newsrack permittees under this code.\u00a0 The Board shall receive a recommendation from the City\u2019s Risk Manager prior to setting the limits of liability insurance based on the number of racks that each permittee maintains in the City\u2019s right-of-way.\n\n\t(E)\tEvery person who installs, uses or maintains any newsrack which in

External lettering is restricted to the following:\n\n\t(A)\tIf the newsrack is situated next to the curb, the side parallel to the curb, next to the lanes of traffic, may have external lettering replicating the publication masthead style and color, for the permitted publication in the subject newsrack, in a total area not to exceed 144 square inches.\n\n\tIf an individual newsrack is used to distribute more than one publication, each publication distributed in that newsrack shall be entitled to have external lettering replicating the publication masthead style and color for the permitted publications in the subject newsrack.\u00a0 However, the total area for all such publication mastheads on that newsrack shall not exceed 144 square inches.\n\n\t(B)\tThe side of the newsrack facing pedestrian traffic, except in Specific Plan\/Streetscape Plan Areas, as identified in Section (17), may have a \u201cRack Card\u201d, with a total area not to exceed 238 square inches, which exclusively advertises the newspaper or periodical being dispensed, and shall not include any third party advertising.\u00a0 This \u201cRack Card\u201d shall be located in the area immediately below the hood on the front access side of the newsrack.\n\n\t(C)\tOther than as permitted in this section, no other lettering or advertising of any kind shall be permitted anywhere else on the newsrack, including the mount.\n\n\t(9)\tAuthority of the Board of Public Works to Promulgate Rules and Regulations for the Permitting, Installation and Maintenance of the Newsracks in the Public Right-of-Way:\u00a0 Consistent with the intent and requirements of LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f), et seq., the Board may adopt rules and regulations to administer the installation, placement, maintenance, size and material used for construction of newsracks.\u00a0 The Board may adopt any other rule and\/or regulation for the protection of public safety, welfare, or property relative to permitting, installation, and maintenance of newsracks.\u00a0 Prior to adoption of any rules and\/or regulations, the Board shall hold a public hearing.\u00a0 Once any rules and\/or regulations are adopted, they shall be kept posted in the Board office and a copy thereof shall be furnished to any applicant for a newsrack permit.\n\n\t(10)\tNoncompliance With LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f), et seq.; Tagging of Newsracks:\u00a0 Except as provided in Subsection (12) hereof, whenever any newsrack is found to be in violation of any Subsection of LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f), the Board shall cause a notice tag to be attached to said newsrack specifying the date and nature of the violation, and shall E-mail or fax to the permittee a copy of the violation.\u00a0 Permittee shall within ten (10) calendar days from the date on which the tag was attached, either cause the violation to be corrected or request a hearing pursuant to Subsection (13) hereof.\u00a0 If a hearing is requested, staff will not remove the non compliant newsrack until a final determination by the Board. However, if a newsrack installed within the City right-of-way has no visible evidence that it has been properly permitted (no City issued bar code decal, no visible contact information for the owner or no other evidence that would indicate that a valid permit for the newsrack had been issued) staff may confiscate the offending newsrack and follow the procedures in subparagraph (11)(B) below.\u00a0 There is hereby created a presumption that any newsrack within the City\u2019s right-of-way that does not have a city bar code decal, or visible identification and contact information for the owner of the newsrack, has been installed without a valid permit.\n\n\t(A)\tA newsrack may be tagged for any violation of any requirement of LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f) including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n\t(1)\tWhere its installation, use or maintenance unreasonably interferes with or impedes the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic;\n\n\t(2)\tWhere its installation, use or maintenance interferes with the use of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes or other objects legally permitted;\n\n\t(3)\tWhere its installation, use or maintenance unreasonably obstructs, interferes with or impedes access to or the use of abutting property, including, but not limited to, residences, places of business, or legally parked or stopped vehicles;\n\n\t(4)\tWhen such newsrack does not have a name, address and telephone number affixed in a place where such information may be easily seen and the designee of such newsrack cannot be otherwise identified;\n\n\t(5)\tWhen a newsrack is found in the public right-of-way which does not have a visible, city issued, bar code decal present indicating the correct permit number of the newsrack or the newsrack has no valid permit at all;

Districts, which have a standard streetscape color, to allow for a uniform newsrack color from a limited palate of colors in order to coordinate the color of newsracks with their

ordinance which in whole or in part rests upon, in, or over any dedicated sidewalk, right-of-way or parkway.\u00a0 Those newsracks installed prior to the effective date of this revised ordinance shall be brought into compliance with the all provisions of this code, except uniform color, as this revised ordinance is implemented by Street Services, area by area, within the City.\u00a0 In no event shall compliance be later than 12 months after the effective date hereof, except that, if the City\u2019s implementation schedule takes longer than 12 months, then compliance by the publishers shall follow the City\u2019s implementation schedule.\u00a0 If a publisher chooses not to come into compliance with the uniform color requirement of this ordinance at the time it obtains a valid permit and legally places its newsracks as required by the City\u2019s implementation schedule, then compliance with the uniform color requirement must be accomplished no later than 24 months after the effective date of this ordinance.\u00a0 However, Publishers experiencing financial hardship, solely due to compliance with LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f) as it applies to uniform color, may request the Board to approve one 12-month extension allowing them a total of 36 months to come into full compliance with the uniform color requirement of the Newsrack Ordinance, if evidence of financial hardship is proven to the satisfaction of the Board.\u00a0 Any newsrack not brought into compliance within the aforementioned time period shall be deemed to be in violation of LAMC \u00a7 42.00 (f).\n\n\t(4)\tPermit

below, and the application is accompanied by the appropriate permit fee for the type of newsrack, single, pedestal, or modular, for each individual newsrack installation requested.\u00a0 Any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this code shall only be valid as to the specific location specified in the permit application.\u00a0 Where application is made for the installation of two or more

the newsrack will have a coin-box attachment, or equivalent.\n\n\t(6)\tA sworn statement under penalty of perjury, executed by an officer, director, or authorized agent of the applicant, agreeing that the applicant shall not sell, assign, or transfer by any method, the permit for the newsrack location to any other publisher, distributor, entity or individual.\n\n\t(7)\tThe Board, with Council approval, may designate areas of the City where only modular newsracks may be installed and maintained by a City vendor such as the City Hall Historical District, (the east block face on Spring Street between Temple Street and 1st Street, the south block face of Temple Street between Spring Street and Main Street, the west block face of Main Street between Temple Street and 1st Street, and the north block face of 1st Street between Spring Street and Main Street).\u00a0 No application for an individual newsrack permit may be submitted in a modular newsrack area. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, the total number of compartments in modular newsracks in any designated modular newsrack area, shall be substantially equivalent to the highest total number of individual newsracks known to have been legally maintained on the public right-of-way in the modular newsrack areas at any one time during the year preceding the introduction of this amended ordinance but in no event more than the total number of newsracks allowed by subparagraph (F)(4) below.\n\n\t(8)\tSuch other information as, from time to time, may be required by the

either presented in person to the Bureau of Street Services, via the Internet (if available), or mailed via certified mail, postmarked no later than 30 days prior to the date of permit expiration.\u00a0 Failure to renew an existing newsrack permit before its expiration will require the payment of a late renewal penalty as set forth in Subsection (4)(C), below, or the loss of the placement of the said rack at the subject location.\n\n\t(C)\tFees.\u00a0 The Board shall establish all fees, in accordance with the level of enforcement deemed appropriate by the Council, and shall only be used to defray the total expenses of operation of the newsrack program including: permitting, inspection, administration, and enforcement, required by this Ordinance as set forth in the preceding and following sections of this code.\u00a0 The Initial Permit Fee, the Renewal Permit Fee, the Site Inspection Fee, the Site Re-Inspection Fee, Late Renewal Penalty Fee, Impound Fees, and

its original amount by the permittee at permittee\u2019s expense at all times during the period for which the permittee holds a valid permit or permits.\u00a0 Should said policy be called upon to satisfy any liability for damages covered by said policy, the policy must be of such a nature that the original amount of coverage is restored after any payment of damages by the policy.\u00a0 In the event that two or more permits are issued to one permittee, the permittee shall only be required to maintain a single policy of insurance covering all such permits held by the permittee in the amount set forth below for the number of newsracks maintained by the permittee.\n\n\t(2)\tRequired Limits of Liability Insurance.\u00a0 The Board shall be responsible, from time to time, for adopting the limits of liability insurance required to be maintained by newsrack permittees under this code.\u00a0 The Board shall receive a recommendation from the City\u2019s Risk Manager prior to setting the limits of liability insurance based on the number of racks that each permittee maintains in the City\u2019s right-of-way.\n\n\t(E)\tEvery person who installs, uses or maintains any newsrack which in
