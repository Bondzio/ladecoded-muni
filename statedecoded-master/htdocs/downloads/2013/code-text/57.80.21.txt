AIR CIRCULATION. (§ 57.80.21)

  AIR CIRCULATION.	A.	All spray areas shall be provided with mechanical
ventilation adequate to remove flammable or combustible vapors to a safe
location.  All spray booths where flammable or combustible liquids are sprayed
shall have the spray gun interlocked with the booth ventilation system to
prevent spraying while the ventilation system is shut off.	B.	Exhaust systems of
ventilation shall be designed to maintain a minimum air velocity of 100 linear
feet per minute over the entire cross sectional area of a spray room or over the
entire frontal areas of spray booths and spray tunnels.  Such exhaust system of
ventilation shall be continuously operated during spraying operations.  When
spray is automatically applied without an attendant constantly on duty, the
operating control of spray apparatus shall be arranged so that spray cannot be
applied unless exhaust fans are in operation. Noncombustible baffles shall be
provided where necessary to provide air distribution.	C.	Every booth equipped
with a recovery system using a water spray or solution tank shall comply with
all requirements of this article governing spray application of flammable
liquids.	D.	Each spray booth shall have an independent exhaust duct system
except as provided in Section 57.80.30.  If more than one fan serves a single
booth, all such fans shall be interconnected so that one cannot operate without
operating all.DUCTS
