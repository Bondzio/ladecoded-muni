No. 175,029*, Eff. 2\/5\/03, Oper. 2\/1\/03.)\n\n\t(a)\t(Amended by Ord. No. 182,275, Eff. 11\/20\/12.)\u00a0 A business that establishes a new fixed location within the City and is not owned, in whole or in part, by a person that was engaged in business in an existing fixed location in the City in the immediately preceding tax year, is a \u201cNew Business\u201d that shall be exempt from the applicable minimum tax for its first tax year of operation.\u00a0 This business shall also be exempt from any other tax imposed under this Article for up to its first two tax years of operation, or its first three tax years of operation if the business first commenced operations between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, as follows:\n\n\t1.\tFor its first two tax years of operation, a New Business that has less than $500,000.00 of total taxable yearly gross receipts shall be exempt from any additional tax imposed pursuant to this article for any tax year in which it has less than $500,000 in total taxable gross receipts.\u00a0 However, if a New Business first commences operations between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, a New Business shall be exempt from any minimum or additional tax imposed pursuant to this Article for its first three tax years of operation, regardless of how much tax would be imposed absent this exemption.\u00a0 A business qualifying for exemption under this subdivision for its first tax year of operation shall also be exempt from the applicable minimum tax for its second tax year of operation, or its second and third tax years of operation if it first commences operations between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015.\n\n\t(i)\tThe exemption for tax in the second tax year of business operation is extended to December 31, 2017.\u00a0 The exemptions for tax for the second and third tax years of business operations are subject to review and may result in a suspension under any of the following circumstances as determined by the Council, subject to the approval of the Mayor:\n\n\t(A)\tThe City experiences a major natural or man-made disaster including, but not limited to, earthquakes, fires, or terrorist incident, for which the response and recovery require expenditure of more than one percent of General Fund revenues (i.e., $40,000,000 in 2006-07); or\n\n\t(B)\tAn economic downturn resulting in a greater than one percent overall actual decline in all General Fund revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30th of that year (i.e., $40,000,000 in 2006-07); or\n\n\t(C)\tThe City is legislatively, legally or otherwise precluded from levying and collecting General Fund revenue that results in a greater than one percent total decline in budgeted General Fund revenue for the fiscal year (i.e., $40,000,000 in 2006-07); or\n\n\t(D)\tThe City receives a legal judgment for which either an option for legal appeal does not exist, or the City Council and Mayor decline to pursue that legal appeal, and the judgment exceeds ten percent of the Reserve Fund (i.e., $18,500,000 in 2006-07); or\n\n\t(E)\tThere is a non-discretionary occurrence requiring expenditure of funds from the Emergency Reserve Account of the Reserve Fund.\n\n\t(ii)\tTo implement a suspension of the exemption in a given calendar year, action by the Council, subject to the approval of the Mayor, must be made by September 30th of the preceding calendar year.\n\n\t(iii)\tThe exemption period shall be in effect for ten years unless the Council takes one of the following actions:\u00a0 (a) before September 30th of the fifth year the Council takes an affirmative action not to extend the exemption period for a second consecutive five year period; or (b) prior to September 30th of the tenth year of the exemption period, the Council extends the exemption period beyond ten years.\u00a0 A suspension of the tax exemption will result in an equivalent period being added to the original ten-year exemption period, or five-year exemption period if the Council takes action not to extend the exemption period for the second five-year period.\u00a0 This would result in the sunset clause of the ordinance expiring at the end of ten years, or the number of years the exemption was in effect plus any suspension period, whichever is greater, but in no event would the actual number of years of second year tax exemption exceed ten, unless the Council takes an affirmative action to extend the exemption period beyond ten years, or if the council takes an action not to extend the exemption period for a second five-year period, the sunset clause of the ordinance would expire at the end of the fifth year, or the number of years the exemption was in effect plus any suspension period, whichever is greater, but in no event would the actual number of years of second year tax exemption exceed five.\n\n\t(iv)\tReinstatement of the tax exemption shall require approval of the Council, subject to the approval of the Mayor.\n\n\t2.\tA new business shall not include a construction business involved in the following activities:\u00a0 single-family housing construction (as defined by the 1997 NAICS Industry Code 233210);
