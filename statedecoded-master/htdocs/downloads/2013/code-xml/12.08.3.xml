	Said declaration may provide for the establishment of an association of property owners to administer the provisions of the declaration, and, if so, shall provide for its organization and government as well as for the assessment of lot owners to provide for the costs of maintenance, repair and administration.

	A Copy of such declaration shall be delivered to the Department of Building and Safety prior to the issuance of a building permit, and copies shall be delivered to any prospective owner of a lot prior to the sale of that lot.

residential zone.	B.	Use.&#xA0; No building, structure or land shall be used and no
building or structure shall be erected, structurally altered, enlarged, or
maintained, except for the following uses, and, when a &#x201C;Supplemental Use

lot lines shall underlie and support said walls between dwelling
units.	b.	Electrical, plumbing, heating, air conditioning and sewer systems for
each dwelling unit shall be separate and independent of such system for each
other dwelling unit.	c.	Prior to the issuance of any building permit for such
development, the owner or owners shall execute and record a declaration of
covenants, conditions and servitudes in a form designed to run with the land and
satisfactory to the City Attorney, binding themselves and all future owners and
inuring to their mutual benefit and that of the City of Los Angeles. The
declaration shall contain provisions:	(1)	That the owners of all lots on which
such building is located shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
maintenance and repair of the building&#x2019;s footings, slab foundations, roof
sheathing, roofing, common walls, exterior walls and any other common portion of
the building;	(2)	That the costs for such maintenance and repair shall be shared
equitably by the owners of the lots on which the building is
located;	(3)	Providing the manner in which decisions concerning such maintenance
and repair and their payment shall be decided;	(4)	That the owners of each such
lot shall have a right of access to each others lot for the purpose of affecting
such maintenance and repair; and	(5)	Providing for the rights of individual lot
owners concerning the demolition or modification of any portion of the building,
including a provision that no common element be modified without the consent of
all affected lot owners.	Said declaration may provide for the establishment of
an association of property owners to administer the provisions of the
declaration, and, if so, shall provide for its organization and government as
well as for the assessment of lot owners to provide for the costs of
maintenance, repair and administration.	A Copy of such declaration shall be
delivered to the Department of Building and Safety prior to the issuance of a
building permit, and copies shall be delivered to any prospective owner of a lot
prior to the sale of that lot.	2.	One&#x2013;Family Dwellings.	3.	Parks, playgrounds
or community centers owned and operated by governmental agency.	4.	Accessory
buildings, including private garages and recreation rooms&#xA0; For location of

5/9/87.)	a.	Except as exempted by Paragraph b or Paragraph c of this
subdivision, there shall be a side yard of not less than three feet in width on
each side of a main building of not more than two stories. For a building more
than two stories in height, one foot shall be added to the width of such side

across which line a dwelling is constructed in accordance with Section 12.08.3B1
of this Code.	4.	If a lot is developed without a rear yard, the area of the
front yard and/or any side yards shall be increased so that the total increase
in the combined areas of the front yard and any side yards shall equal 110% of
the area which would otherwise have been contained in a rear yard.	5.	Lot
