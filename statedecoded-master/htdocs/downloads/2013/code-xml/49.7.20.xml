	A.	Every elected City officer or candidate for elected City office may establish and maintain a legal defense fund for a civil or criminal court case or administrative proceeding arising directly out of the conduct of an election campaign, the electoral process, or the performance of the officeholder&#x2019;s governmental activities and duties.

	1.	In addition to contributions received in connection with an election to an elected City office or to defray officeholder expenses, an elected City officer or candidate for elected City office who receives contributions for a legal defense fund may use those funds solely to defray attorney&#x2019;s fees and other legal costs incurred in the officeholder&#x2019;s or candidate&#x2019;s legal defense to the civil or criminal court case or administrative proceeding.

	2.	The officeholder or candidate shall file with the Ethics Commission a Statement of Purpose identifying the specific civil or criminal court case or administrative proceedings for which the legal defense fund is established.&#xA0; The Statement of Purpose shall be filed before any contributions are solicited or accepted.

	5.	The committee shall establish one checking account at an office of a financial institution located in the City for the legal defense fund.&#xA0; All contributions received in connection with the legal defense fund shall be deposited into that account.

	B.	A person may not make, and an elected City officer or candidate for elected City office may not solicit or accept from a single person, contributions totaling more than $1,000 during a fiscal year to a legal defense fund in connection with a single court case or administrative proceeding identified in the Statement of Purpose.

	C.	Within six months after the final conclusion of the case or proceeding and the payment of all debts incurred in connection with that case or proceeding, any surplus legal defense funds may be used in connection with another legal defense fund, returned to donors on a pro rata basis, or given to the City&#x2019;s General Fund.

	D.	This Section is the sole authority for soliciting or accepting contributions for the defense of an action relating to an election campaign, electoral process, or an officeholder&#x2019;s conduct in office.</full_text><order_by>7.20</order_by><ancestry><unit id="12" label="article"><name>Campaign Financing</name><identifier>9.7</identifier><url>/4/9.7/</url></unit><unit id="11" label="chapter"><name>Public Welfare</name><identifier>4</identifier><url>/4/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="437"><structure_id>12</structure_id><section_number>49.7.32</section_number><catch_line>1.
