The Office of Finance shall fix a time, date and place for hearing any protests or objections to the list, and shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed to each owner of the parcels of real properly to be subjected to the lien not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of hearing. Any person opposing the lien upon real property which is owned by such person may submit his or her protest either in writing, orally, or both. The oral hearing may be continued from time-to-time as schedules require. The Office of Finance shall keep a record of the notices, the persons to whom such notices were mailed, the date of mailing, and the person responsible for the mailing.

The burden of going forward with the evidence to establish the incorrectness of the list shall be upon the person opposing the proposed lien. Upon a conclusion of the hearing, the Office of Finance shall confirm and verify the list to be recorded in the County Recorder\u2019s Office.

Such lien shall have the same force, effect, priority and duration as to the real properly described as would the lien of an abstract of judgment against the owner of real property at the time such list is recorded and may be enforced in like manner.\n\n\tProperty may be discharged from the lien by the payment of all delinquent charges plus penalties. A list of all such delinquent charges shall be recorded at least every six months, but no delay or informality in recording the same shall invalidate the lien or any unpaid charge or any subsequent act or proceeding. If through error or otherwise the amount of any unpaid charge plus penalties thereon as stated in said list shall be incorrect, said error shall be disregarded and shall not affect or invalidate the filing if said error is one dollar ($1.00) or less.\n\n\tThe Director shall provide such information, as necessary, to the Office of Finance in reference to property descriptions and owners.\n\n\t(k)\tThe sewer service charge shall be a civil debt owing to the City of Los Angeles from the user of any premises from which sewage is received or collected into the sewer system, or from any other person billed as provided in this section. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this article shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the City of Los Angeles in any court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of such amount and any penalty imposed thereon pursuant to the terms of this article.

The Board of Review may call for additional evidence as it may deem relevant. Upon unanimous approval of a finding by the Board of Review, the Office of Finance may remove from his active accounts receivable said unpaid sewer service charge and penalty. If the Board of Review does not unanimously recommend approval of the finding, the matter shall be returned to the Office of Finance. The Office of Finance may include in a single report his findings and supporting reasons regarding the sewer service charge and penalty due from more than one user or person billed. The removal from the active accounts receivable of the Office of Finance of any unpaid sewer service charge and penalty as provided for by this article shall not preclude the City from collecting or attempting to collect any such sewer service charge and penalty.\n\n\t(m)\tThe Office of Finance for and in the name of the City of Los Angeles may enter into a written agreement in form approved by the City Attorney, with any person indebted to The City of Los Angeles pursuant to the terms of this article obligating said person to pay such indebtedness to the Office of Finance in monthly or more frequent installments, but in no event over a period greater than one year. In any such agreement such person, whether corporate, individual or otherwise, shall acknowledge the obligation owed to the City and his indebtedness thereon, shall agree that in the event of his failure to make timely payment of any installment thereof that the whole amount then due and unpaid may be determined by the Office of Finance to be immediately due and payable in full, and shall agree to pay all costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by or on behalf of the City in collection thereof or for any legal proceeding commenced for said purpose.\n\n\t(n)\tWhenever a payment mailed to the City is received after the time prescribed in this article for receipt thereof, the Office of Finance or Water and Power as the case may be, may accept proof that there had been a timely deposit thereof in the United States mail and that no delinquency or penalty is applicable thereto.\n\n\t(o)\tWhenever the amount of a sewer service charge and penalty, or either, is determined by Water and Power or by the Office of Finance to have been overpaid, paid more than once, or to have been erroneously collected or received by it in whole or in part, the office making said determination may provide for correction thereof either by refund or by credit on future bills in its discretion.\n\n\t(p)\tWhere there is a dispute with respect to the sewer service charges or penalties or both, owing to the City, the Office of Finance, with the written approval of the City Attorney and subject to the provisions of the Charter of the City of Los Angeles, may compromise the amount of the City\u2019s claim for sewer service charges or penalties, or both, which may apply thereto where the portion of the amount proposed to be released is less than $500.00; and with the approval of the City Attorney and the City Council, may compromise such amount where the portion proposed to be released is $500.00 or more.\n\n\t(q)\tRemedies for collecting and enforcing rates and charges set out in this article are cumulative and may be pursued alternately, or any thereof may be used consecutively when the City Council so determines. If any one of said remedies is or may be invalid, all valid remedies shall remain effectual until the principal and interest of the bonds are fully paid. Any holder of any bond outstanding at any time may compel the use of any or all of the remedies herein provided. The costs of collection and enforcement of the remedies for the collection or charges may be paid from the revenues.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

Upon unanimous approval of a finding by the Board of Review, the Office of Finance may remove from his active accounts receivable said unpaid sewer service charge and penalty. If the Board of Review does not unanimously recommend approval of the finding, the matter shall be returned to the Office of Finance. The Office of Finance may include in a single report his findings and supporting reasons regarding the sewer service charge and penalty due from more than one user or person billed. The removal from the active accounts receivable of the Office of Finance of any unpaid sewer service charge and penalty as provided for by this article shall not preclude the City from collecting or attempting to collect any such sewer service charge and penalty.\t(m)\tThe Office of Finance for and in the name of the City of Los Angeles may enter into a written agreement in form approved by the City Attorney, with any person indebted to The City of Los Angeles pursuant to the terms of this article obligating said person to pay such indebtedness to the Office of Finance in monthly or more frequent installments, but in no event over a period greater than one year. In any such agreement such person, whether corporate, individual or otherwise, shall acknowledge the obligation owed to the City and his indebtedness thereon, shall agree that in the event of his failure to make timely payment of any installment thereof that the whole amount then due and unpaid may be determined by the Office of Finance to be immediately due and payable in full, and shall agree to pay all costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by or on behalf of the City in collection thereof or for any legal proceeding commenced for said purpose.\t(n)\tWhenever a payment mailed to the City is received after the time prescribed in this article for receipt thereof, the Office of Finance or Water and Power as the case may be, may accept proof that there had been a timely deposit thereof in the United States mail and that no delinquency or penalty is applicable thereto.\t(o)\tWhenever the amount of a sewer service charge and penalty, or either, is determined by Water and Power or by the Office of Finance to have been overpaid, paid more than once, or to have been erroneously collected or received by it in whole or in part, the office making said determination may provide for correction thereof either by refund or by credit on future bills in its discretion.\t(p)\tWhere there is a dispute with respect to the sewer service charges or penalties or both, owing to the City, the Office of Finance, with the written approval of the City Attorney and subject to the provisions of the Charter of the City of Los Angeles, may compromise the amount of the City\u2019s claim for sewer service charges or penalties, or both, which may apply thereto where the portion of the amount proposed to be released is less than $500.00; and with the approval of the City Attorney and the City Council, may compromise such amount where the portion proposed to be released is $500.00 or more.\t(q)\tRemedies for collecting and enforcing rates and charges set out in this article are cumulative and may be pursued alternately, or any thereof may be used consecutively when the City Council so determines. If any one of said remedies is or may be invalid, all valid remedies shall remain effectual until the principal and interest of the bonds are fully paid. Any holder of any bond outstanding at any time may compel the use of any or all of the remedies herein provided. The costs of collection and enforcement of the remedies for the collection or charges may be paid from the revenues.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.
