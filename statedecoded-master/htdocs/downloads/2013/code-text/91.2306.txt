ALLOWABLE STRESS DESIGN. (§ 91.2306)

  ALLOWABLE STRESS DESIGN.
	(Amended by Ord. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)91.2306.2.1. Wood Structural Panel
Diaphragms.  Wood structural panel diaphragms shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with AF&#038;PA SDPWS. Wood structural panel diaphragms are
permitted to resist horizontal forces using the allowable shear capacities set
forth in CBC Table 2306.2.1(1) or CBC Table 2306.2.1(2). For structures assigned
to Seismic Design Category D, E or F, the allowable shear capacities shall be
set forth in Table 2306.2.1(3) or 2306.2.1(4). The allowable shear capacities in
CBC Table 2306.2.1(1) or CBC 2306.2.1(2) are permitted to be increased 40
percent for wind design.	Wood structural panel diaphragms fastened with staples
shall not be used to resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic
Design Category D, E or F.	EXCEPTION:  Staples may be used for wood structural
panel diaphragms when the allowable shear values are substantiated by cyclic
testing and approved by the building official.	Wood structural panel diaphragms
used to resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category
D, E or F shall be applied directly to the framing members. 	EXCEPTION:  Wood
structural panel diaphragm is permitted to be fastened over solid lumber
planking or laminated decking, provided the panel joints and lumber planking or
laminated decking joints do not coincide.TABLE 2306.2.1(3)

  For SI:  1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per foot = 14.5939 N/m.a.	For framing of
other species: (1) Find specific gravity for species of lumber in AF&#038;PA
NDS. (2) For nails find shear value from table above for nail size for actual
grade and multiply value by the following adjustment factor: Specific Gravity
Adjustment Factor = [1-(0.5-SG)], where SG= Specific Gravity of the framing
lumber. This adjustment factor shall not be greater than 1.
b.	Space fasteners maximum 12 inches o.c. along intermediate framing members (6
inches o.c. where supports are spaced 48 inches o.c.).
c.	Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or thicker, and
nails at all panel edges shall be staggered where panel edge nailing is
specified at 2 ½ inches o.c. or less.
d.	Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or thicker, and
nails at all panel edges shall be staggered where both of the following
conditions are met: (1) 10d nails having penetration into framing of more than 1
½ inches and (2) panel edge nailing is specified at 3 inches o.c. or less.
e.	8d is recommended minimum for roofs due to negative pressures of high winds.
f.	The minimum nominal width of framing members not located at boundaries or
adjoining panel edges shall be 2 inches.
g.	For shear loads of normal or permanent load duration as defined by the
AF&#038;PA NDS, the values in the table above shall be multiplied by 0.63 or
0.56, respectively.TABLE 2306.2.1(4)

inches on center, except 6 inches on center for spans greater than 32 inches.
c.	Panels conforming to PS1 or PS 2.
d.	This table gives shear values for Cases 1 and 2 as shown in Table
2306.2.1(3). The values shown are applicable to Cases 3, 4, 5 and 6 as shown in
Table 2306.2.1(3), providing fasteners at all continuous panels edges are spaced
in accordance with the boundary fastener spacing.
e.	The minimum nominal depth of framing members shall be 3 inches nominal. The
minimum nominal width of framing members not located at boundaries or adjoining
panel edges shall be 2 inches.
f.	High load diaphragms shall be subject to special inspection in accordance
with CBC Section 1704.6.1.

Panel Shear Walls.  Wood structural panel shear walls shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with AF&#038;PA SDPWS.  Wood structural panel shear
walls are permitted to resist horizontal forces using the allowable shear
capacities set forth in Table 2306.3(1).  For structures assigned to Seismic
Design Category D, E or F, the allowable shear capacities shall be set forth in
Table 2306.3(2).  The allowable shear capacities in Table 2306.3(1) are
permitted to be increased 40 percent for wind design.	Wood structural panel
shear walls used to resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic
Design Category D, E or F shall not be less than 4 feet by 8 feet (1219 mm by
2438 mm), except at boundaries and at changes in framing.  Wood structural
panel thickness for shear walls shall not be less than 3/8 inch thick and studs
shall not be spaced at more than 16 inches on center.	The maximum allowable
shear value for three-ply plywood resisting seismic forces in structures
assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F is 200 pounds per foot (2.92
kn/m). Nails shall be placed not less than 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) in from the panel
edges and not less than 3/8 inch (9.5mm) from the edge of the connecting members

N/m.a.	For framing of other species: (1) Find specific gravity for species of
lumber in AF&#038;PA NDS. (2) For nails find shear value from table above for
nail size for actual grade and multiply value by the following adjustment
factor: Specific Gravity Adjustment Factor = [1-(0.5-SG)], where SG = Specific
Gravity of the framing lumber. This adjustment factor shall not be greater than
1.
b.	Panel edges backed with 2-inch nominal or thicker framing. Install panels
either horizontally or vertically. Space fasteners maximum 6 inches on center
along intermediate framing members for 3/8-inch and 7/16-inch panels installed
on studs spaced 24 inches on center. For other conditions and panel thickness,
space fasteners maximum 12 inches on center on intermediate supports.
c.	3/8-inch panel thickness or siding with a span rating of 16 inches on center
is the minimum recommended where applied direct to framing as exterior siding.
For grooved panel siding, the nominal panel thickness is the thickness of the
panel measured at the point of nailing.
d.	Allowable shear values are permitted to be increased to values shown for
15/32-inch sheathing with same nailing provided (a) studs are spaced a maximum
of 16 inches on center, or (b) panels are applied with long dimension across
studs.
e.	Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or thicker, and
nails shall be staggered where nails are spaced 2 inches on center or less.
f.	Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or thicker, and
nails shall be staggered where both of the following conditions are met: (1) 10d
(3&#038;″x0.148&#038;″) nails having penetration into framing of more than
1-1/2 inches and (2) nails are spaced 3 inches on center or less.
g.	Values apply to all-veneer plywood. Thickness at point of fastening on panel
edges governs shear values.
h.	Where panels applied on both faces of a wall and nail spacing is less than 6
inches o.c. on either side, panel joints shall be offset to fall on different
framing members. Or framing shall be 3-inch nominal or thicker at adjoining
panel edges and nails at all panel edges shall be staggered.
i.	Where shear design values exceed 350 pounds per linear foot, all framing
members receiving edge nailing from abutting panels shall not be less than a
single 3-inch nominal member, or two 2-inch nominal members fastened together in
accordance with CBC Section 2306.1 to transfer the design shear value between
framing members. Wood structural panel joint and sill plate nailing shall be
staggered at all panel edges. See Section 4.3.6.1 and 4.3.6.4.3 of AF&#038;PA
SDPWS for sill plate size and anchorage requirements.
j.	Galvanized nails shall be hot dipped or tumbled.
k.	For shear loads of normal or permanent load duration as defined by the
AF&#038;PA NDS, the values in the table above shall be multiplied by 0.63 or

l.	The maximum allowable shear value for three-ply plywood resisting seismic
forces is 200 pounds per foot (2.92 kn/m).91.2306.7. Shear Walls Sheathed with
Other Materials.  Shear walls sheathed with portland cement plaster, gypsum
lath, gypsum sheathing or gypsum board shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with AF&#038;PA SDPWS.  Shear walls sheathed with these materials
are permitted to resist horizontal forces using the allowable shear capacities
set forth in CBC Table 2306.7.  Shear walls sheathed with portland cement
plaster, gypsum lath, gypsum sheathing or gypsum board shall not be used to
resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category E or
F.	Shear walls sheathed with lath, plaster or gypsum board shall not be used
below the top level in a multi-level building for structures assigned to Seismic
Design Category D.
