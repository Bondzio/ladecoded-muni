                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

APPLIANCES, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT. (§ 98.0502)

  APPLIANCES, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT.	(a)	Scope.  All appliances, fixtures and
equipment which are required by the respective Codes to be approved and for
which standards are therein cited, or for which standards or specifications have
been adopted by the Superintendent, shall be approved by the Department before
they may be sold, installed or used.	For the purpose of this section, sale or
selling shall refer to any act of selling, offering for sale, displaying or
advertising for sale, loaning, renting, leasing, or disposing of by way of gift
or premium or otherwise, in connection with the sale or disposal of equipment,
fixtures or appliances as designated in this section.	A label or seal of an
approved nationally recognized testing agency attached to an item or any
identification marking corresponding to a published listing by an approved
nationally recognized testing agency indicating that the item has been tested
for compliance with the standards cited in the applicable Code or adopted by the
Superintendent, and indicating that the item is included in the testing
agency’s factory follow-up inspection and listing service, will be accepted in
lieu of approval by the Department.	This section shall not apply to general
approvals issued pursuant to Section 98.0501 of this article.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 180,868, Eff. 10/22/09.)	(b)	Authority of Superintendent.  The
Superintendent has the authority to establish standards, specifications and
special requirements for materials and methods of construction when standards or
specifications are not cited in the Code.  The Superintendent has the authority
to establish rules and regulations for the Mechanical Testing Laboratory and for
the Electrical Testing Laboratory governing requirements for tests,
examinations, procedures and approvals, and to  establish supplemental fees,
including mileage charges for field trips, and charges for examinations and
inspections.  The rules and regulations shall be in writing and on file in the
Department and shall have the same force and effect as if they were included in
any of the respective articles.	(c)	Applications of Tests and Approvals.  Any
person submitting any appliance, fixture or equipment for tests, examination,
approval or renewal of approval, as required by this section, shall file an
application therefore with the Department on forms provided by the Department.	A
separate application shall be made for each item or appliance, fixture or
equipment to be tested or examined, unless otherwise determined by the
Department, and shall bear the signature of the applicant.  When necessary,
arrangements may be made for all or part of the tests and examinations to be
conducted in the field.  Should the testing facilities of the Department be
inadequate to determine compliance with the standards, the Superintendent may
use available facilities outside the Department, provided the applicant is first
notified and the additional cost, if any, is approved by the applicant in
writing, for invoicing to and payment by him.  The Department may, at its
discretion, accept tests and reports of tests by an approved testing agency as a
basis in part or in full for granting an approval.	(d)	Fees.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 180,868, Eff. 10/22/09.)  Applications for initial approvals and renewals
pursuant to Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of Chapter IX of this Code shall be

to be paid in advance.  Initial applications will expire 12 months after the
filing date if the equipment has not been cleared of corrections and approved. 
No approval shall be issued until the application is refilled and a new fee
paid.2	Processing time includes office and field review and testing, office and
field consultation, field standby and travel time directly related to the
application.3	This fee is in addition to other fees specified in this section. 
The 60 day period may be extended by the Department when the applicant submits
written evidence to the Department of a satisfactory reason for the
extension.NOTE:  A file shall not be reopened after one year from date of

which are in excess of the total actual fees are refundable.	(e)	Test Samples. 
At the time of filing the application, unless otherwise directed in writing by
the Department, the applicant shall submit to the Electrical Testing Laboratory,
or the Mechanical Testing Laboratory, or any testing agency as may be designated
by the Department, a representative production sample of the material, device,
appliance or equipment to be tested and examined, unless arrangements have been
made for conducting the tests and examinations on a representative production
sample in the field. Additional samples shall be made available as may be
required.	All wiring diagrams and additional electrical samples, including
components, special ingredients, or materials required by Subsection (f) shall
be made available to the Department and conform to the standards which the
electrical equipment must meet before approval can be considered as specified in
Subsection (f). If the electrical item submitted for test is determined by the
Department to be within the practical range of review by the Electrical Testing
Laboratory, it shall be accepted and subjected to the tests required by
Subsection (f). Samples shall be removed by the applicant or his authorized
agent upon notification to do so by the Department, or they may be scrapped upon
written authorization by the applicant. Samples unclaimed six (6) months after

standards adopted by the Superintendent shall be tested for compliance with
applicable portions of these standards. The Superintendent shall determine the
specific standards or portions thereof to which any specific equipment must
conform.	(g)	Approvals.  Whenever any appliance, fixture or equipment has been
found to comply with the provisions of this section and the applicable Code, the
Department shall issue an approval therefor for a period of one year. This
approval is subject in every case to continued compliance with the provisions of
this section and any further amendments to this section, and is subject to the
requirements of the applicable articles, except where such articles are in
conflict herewith, and subject also in every case to any change in the test or
approval requirements for any such material, device, appliance or
equipment.	Items submitted for approval which fail to meet the test or
examination requirements shall be corrected and resubmitted as set forth in the
Mechanical Testing Laboratory or Electrical Testing Laboratory rules and
regulations adopted by the Superintendent before an approval can be
granted.	(h)	Renewal of Approval.  (Amended by Ord. No. 156,024, Eff.
12/26/81.)  Upon expiration of an approval granted for any appliance, fixture
or equipment, or upon any change in design, material, method of construction or
model designation made during the period of approval, it shall be unlawful to
sell, offer or advertise for sale, or install the appliance, fixture or
equipment until a renewal of approval has been granted under the provisions of
