Where there are two or more possible combinations of developed lots comprising 40% or more of the frontage, each of which has front yards that vary in depth of not more than ten feet, the minimum front yard depth shall be the average depth of the front yards of that combination which has the shallowest average depth. In determining the required front yard, buildings located on key lots, entirely on the rear half of lots, or on lots in the \u201cC\u201d or \u201cM\u201d Zones, shall not be counted, provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph shall be deemed to require front yards which exceed 40 feet in depth.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.
