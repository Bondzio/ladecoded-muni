  INDOOR WATER USE.99.10.303.1.  Meters.  For every addition, separate meters
or metering device shall be installed for the uses described in Sections
99.10.303.1.1 and 99.10.303.1.2.99.10.303.1.1.  Additions in Excess of 50,000
Square Feet.  Separate submeters shall be installed for each tenant space
within an addition when the tenant is projected to consume more than 100
gal/day.99.10.303.1.2.  Excess Consumption.  Any addition or space within an
addition that is projected to consume more than 1,000 gal/day.99.10.303.2. 
Water Use Reduction.  New plumbing fixtures and fittings shall not exceed the
maximum allowable flow rate specified in Table 10.303.2.3.99.10.303.3. 
Multiple Showerheads Serving One Shower.  For newly installed showerheads, when
single shower fixtures are served by more than one showerhead, the combined flow
rate of all the showerheads shall not exceed the maximum flow rates specified in
the maximum allowable flow rate column contained in Table 10.303.2.3 or the
shower shall be designed to only allow one showerhead to be in operation at a
time.	EXCEPTION:  When a calculation demonstrating a 20 percent reduction in
the building “water use” baseline as established in Table 10.303.2.2 is
provided, the maximum flow rate may be increased to 2.5 gpm @ 80 psi.TABLE
