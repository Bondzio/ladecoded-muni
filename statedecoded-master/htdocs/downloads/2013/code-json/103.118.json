The Board shall issue no permit to the applicant unless the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\t1.\tThe dance or dancing activity for which an application has been filed conforms to the laws of the City of Los Angeles and of the State of California, and will not constitute a menace to the health, peace or safety of the community;\n\n\t2.\tA sufficient number of adult supervisors who are employees of the location will be provided to insure compliance with the provisions of this section and any rules or regulations promulgated by the Board with respect thereto. For purposes herein, a sufficient number shall constitute, at a minimum, a ratio of one adult to every 35 teenagers in attendance at the teenage dance premises.\n\n\t(f)\tLighting in Hall.\u00a0 Each of the premises where any dance or dancing activity regulated under this section is held, shall be adequately lighted at all times when open for dancing.

In no event shall such an establishment be permitted to continue such teenage dances or dancing activity later than 1:00 a.m.\n\n\t(j)\tTeenagers Under the Age of 15 Years.\u00a0 No person under the age of 15 years shall be permitted to enter any premises where there is dancing activity regulated under this section unless such person is accompanied by a parent or legal guardian unless the parent or legal guardian of such person has signed and filed with the owner, manager or operator of the facility a consent form for such minor to be there unaccompanied by said parent or guardian.

As permitted by California Labor Code Section 432.7, such permittee shall ask all applicants for such employment at the premises about any conviction, as that term is used in said Labor Code Section, and about any arrest for which the applicant is out on bail or on his or her own recognizance pending trial. Copies of the employment applications of all persons hired shall be filed with the Board. Upon a showing of just causes a permittee may apply to the Board for a waiver of this provision. Just cause, as used in this subsection, shall include but is not limited to a demonstration that the prior conviction, or arrest as described herein, would not have an adverse effect on the employee\u2019s ability to supervise teenagers at a location as described within this section. While teenagers are present, all employees also present within the premises, as that term is defined by this section, shall be considered supervisory employees.\n\n\t(r)\tDuty of Management.\u00a0 If a teenager is discovered inside the premises showing evidence or symptoms of being intoxicated as a result of the ingestion of alcohol or any chemical substance, that teenager shall be reported by management to local police authorities and to his or her parent or legal guardian. Management shall attempt to separate the teenager from other teenagers at the premises pending the arrival of police or the parent or legal guardian of the teenager. A notice shall be posted by all pay phones containing the local police telephone number and shall request all patrons to call the police if management neglects to take action to report a violation of

vacated by all customers, and thereafter only those persons 18 years of age or older who present valid identification containing proof of age established as set forth in Subsection (n) herein may be permitted to enter the premises.\n\n\t(t)\tAdditional Restrictions by the Board.\u00a0 The Board may promulgate additional rules as necessary with respect thereto.\n\n\t(u)\tRegulation by Permittee.\u00a0 Nothing herein is intended to preclude the imposition of more restrictive regulations by any permittee so long as the regulations are not in conflict with any provision of this section.","order_by":"118","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"33","name":"Police Permit Regulation","identifier":"3","label":"article","url":"\/10\/3\/"},"2":{"id":"29","name":"Business
