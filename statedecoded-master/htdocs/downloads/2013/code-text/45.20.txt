                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

PURPOSE. (§ 45.20)

  PURPOSE.
	(Article and Section Added by Ord. No. 172,212, Eff. 10/23/98, Oper. 10/23/99.)

	Regulating tobacco product advertising on certain signs is a reasonable and
necessary means to protect and promote the general welfare of the children and
minors of the City of Los Angeles exposed to certain signs advertising tobacco
products.

	The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that children and minors deserve
special solicitude because they lack the ability to assess and fully analyze the
information presented through commercial advertising.

	Signs which can be seen from the outdoors are a unique and distinguishable
medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involuntary and
unavoidable forms of solicitation.

	The regulations promote the general welfare and temperance of children and
minors and are intended to help reduce the illegal consumption and purchase of
tobacco products by children and minors by limiting their exposure to the
advertising of tobacco products on certain on-site and off-site signs.
