STANDING CONCERT ATTENDANCE NOT IN STRUCTURES. (§ 57.110.33)

  STANDING CONCERT ATTENDANCE NOT IN STRUCTURES.
	(Added by Ord. No. 169,944, Eff. 8/20/94.)	No person shall conduct, operate,
maintain or allow standing concert attendance at a public assemblage not in a
structure except by authority of a Special Permit from the Chief.  Such permit
shall be issued only if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Chief that
the physical layout of the event and the proposed security measures are adequate
to insure that the audience will neither rush the stage, nor gather at the stage
in such a manner as to create a dangerous level of crowd density.	In evaluating
the adequacy of such layout and security, the Chief shall consider the
anticipated size, volatility, and behavior of the audience as demonstrated by
the past history of like audiences.
