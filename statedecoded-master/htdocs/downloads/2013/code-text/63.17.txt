BOARD MAY DENY GRANTS. (§ 63.17)

  BOARD MAY DENY GRANTS.	In case the Board of Playground and Recreation
Commissioners deny any application for a grant under Section 63.08 within thirty
(30) days after written notice to the applicant of the denial of the
application, any applicant claiming that the action of the Board of Playground
and Recreation Commissioners is arbitrary or unreasonable, may appeal from the
decision of the Board to the City Council. The City Council shall consider said
application and the facts or the circumstances surrounding the same, and the
reason for denial of the grant and, if the City Council shall in its discretion
determine that the action of said Board is unreasonable and arbitrary, the City
Council may issue such grant on the terms and conditions to be prescribed by the
Council, provided such terms and conditions do not violate any State law or
Charter provisions concerning beach lands, tide lands or waterfront property,
and provided further that such terms and conditions prescribed by the Council do
not violate the provisions of this article relating thereto.
