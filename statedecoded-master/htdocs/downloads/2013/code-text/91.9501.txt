  PURPOSE.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,260, Eff. 8/30/96.)	The purpose of this division is to
promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that
may result from the effects of earthquakes on concrete buildings and concrete
frame buildings with masonry infills. The Northridge Earthquake caused
widespread damage to these buildings, including some collapses.  The recent
Great Hanshin Earthquake in Kobe, Japan also caused collapse or partial collapse
to several hundred of these buildings.  These non-ductile concrete buildings
are frequently used in Los Angeles for department stores, office buildings,
hotels, parking structures and apartment houses.  The performance of these
structures in an earthquake is essential to the life-safety of their occupants
and to significantly reduce the amount of building damage.  This division
provides voluntary retrofit standards that, when fully followed, will
substantially improve the seismic performance of these buildings but will not
necessarily prevent all earthquake damage.
