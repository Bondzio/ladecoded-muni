  MOORING AND CARGO CONNECTIONS.	Loading or discharging is not to commence
until both Terminal Superintendent and officer in charge of tank vessel are
satisfied that tank vessel is properly moored and all connections are properly
made.  At all times when a tank vessel is lying at a wharf, it shall have lines
of such length and tightness as to prevent a surge of the vessel from placing
stress on the hose.	There shall be two emergency wire hausers made fast to bits,
one fore and one aft, on the off-shore side of the vessel, within convenient
reach and of sufficient strength for towing the vessel.
