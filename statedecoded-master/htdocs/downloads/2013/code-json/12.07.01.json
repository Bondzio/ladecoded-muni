Where there are two or more possible combinations of developed lots comprising 40% or more of the frontage, each of which has front yards that vary in depth by not more than ten feet, the minimum front yard depth shall be the average depth of the front yards of that combination which has the shallowest average depth.

Amended by Ord.

Where there are two or more possible combinations of developed lots comprising 40% or more of the frontage, each of which has front yards that vary in depth by not more than ten feet, the minimum front yard depth shall be the average depth of the front yards of that combination which has the shallowest average depth. In determining the required front yard buildings located on key lots, entirely on the rear half of lots, or on lots in the \u201cC\u201d or \u201cM\u201d Zones, shall not be counted, provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph shall be deemed to require front yards which exceed 40 feet in depth. (Amended by Ord. No. 139,155, Eff. 10\/16\/69.)\tOn key lots the minimum front yard may be the average of the required front yard for the adjoining interior lot and the required side yard along the street side of a reversed corner lot, but such minimum front yard may apply for a distance of not more than 85 feet from the rear lot line of the reversed corner lot, beyond which point the front yard specified in the above paragraph shall apply. Where existing buildings on either or both of said adjoining lots are located nearer to the front or side lot lines than the yard required by this article, the yards established by such existing buildings may be used in computing the required front yard for a key lot.\t2.\tSide Yards.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.
