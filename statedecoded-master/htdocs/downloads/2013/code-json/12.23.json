change of use or other alterations, which would require additional parking spaces per this Code, including, but not limited to, additional dwelling units, seating capacity, beds for institutions or guest rooms, existing parking must be maintained and additional parking spaces shall be provided equal to the difference between the number of required parking spaces for the existing use based on current parking regulations set forth in this Code and not on the provisions of Paragraph (a) above, and the number of required parking spaces for the new use or the new capacity created by the alterations, also based on current parking regulations.\n\n\t(c)\tAdditions to Buildings or Structures.\u00a0 The parking requirement for an addition or enlargement to a building or structure that results in an increase in floor area shall be as set forth in the current provisions of this Code.\u00a0 No additional parking spaces shall be required for the original portion of the building, as

No. 178,599, Eff. 5\/26\/07.)\u00a0 Except as provided in Subdivision 1. above, the nonconforming use of land may be continued, subject to the following limitations:\n\n\t(a)\tthat the use is not expanded or extended in any way either on the same or adjoining land beyond the limits of what was originally permitted; and\n\n\t(b)\tthat the use is not changed, except to a use that conforms to the current use regulations of the zone and other applicable current land use regulations; and\n\n\t(c)\tin the MR or M1 Zone, the use shall be completely enclosed within a building or within an area enclosed on all sides with a solid wall or solid fence of a height sufficient to screen the use from public view, but in no event less than six feet in height, within one year from the date the use becomes nonconforming; and\n\n\t(d)\tif the use is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it shall not be reestablished.\n\n\t3.\tContinuation of Signs.\u00a0 Any existing nonconforming sign, as defined in Section 91.6203 of this Code, may be continued, provided that no structural, electrical or mechanical alterations are made to the sign except as permitted in Section 91.6206 of this Code.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

Scheib, CR A 2457.\n\n\tUnder a zoning ordinance authorizing applications to an administrative body for permission to put land to a nonconforming use, it is not a denial of an owner\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws to discriminate against him by granting such application to some owners and refusing a grant to him in the same district.\n\tOtis v. City of Los Angeles, 52 Cal. App. 2d 605.\n\n\tE.\tUse Of Nonconforming Lot.
