  VENTING OF UNDERGROUND TANKS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 172,043, Eff. 7/13/98.)	A.	Every underground tank having
only one fill opening shall be equipped with a vent pipe of not less than one
and one-fourth inch nominal inside diameter. Tanks requiring vapor recovery
systems shall have no less than one vent pipe with a nominal inside diameter of
not less than two inches. Vent pipes shall have the capacity to prevent
back-pressure development in tanks from exceeding 2.5 PSIG.	B.	All Class I
liquid vent pipes shall be 18 inches above the highest point of any roof of any
building within 15 feet of the point of termination. Vent pipes shall terminate
12 feet above the adjacent ground level and not less than 10 feet from building
openings. They shall discharge only upward or horizontally to disperse vapors
away from exposures and hazardous locations.	C.	Every vent pipe shall run
without sag or trap from the top of the tank to which it is connected and shall
be so located and directed that flammable vapors will not accumulate or travel
to an unsafe location, enter building openings, or be trapped under
eaves.	D.	Vent pipes running in a semi-horizontal direction shall be installed
to provide one-fourth inch of fall for each one foot of horizontal run toward
the tank.	E.	Vent pipes shall be located and supported in an approved
manner.	F.	Vent pipes shall be unobstructed and only approved pressure relief
valves or approved ball check valves shall be installed inside the tank.
