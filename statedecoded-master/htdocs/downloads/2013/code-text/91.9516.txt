INFORMATION REQUIRED ON THE PLANS. (§ 91.9516)

  INFORMATION REQUIRED ON THE PLANS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,260, Eff. 8/30/96.)91.9516.1.  General.  In addition
to the seismic analysis required elsewhere in this division, the licensed
engineer responsible for the seismic analysis of the building shall record the
information required by this section on the approved plans.91.9516.2. 
Information Required.  The plans shall accurately reflect the results of the
engineering investigation and design, and show all pertinent dimensions and
sizes for plan review and construction.  The following shall be
provided:	1.	The plans of the existing construction shall be adequately
dimensioned and furnish adequate details in schedules, notes and sections to
fully describe the existing building.  Foundation plan, floor and roof plans
which indicate new work on framing plans of the existing
construction.	2.	Elevations of the structural system showing sizes and
dimensions.	3.	Schedules, sections and details showing reinforcement of walls,
slabs, beams, joists, girders, columns and foundations.	EXCEPTION:  If copies
of the original construction documents are submitted for information during the
plan check, the information required by Items 1, 2 and 3 may be limited to areas
of and adjacent to new construction on a complete outline at that level of the
building.	4.	Sections and details showing attachments and joining of new and
existing structures.  All reinforcement in the existing structure shall be
shown in these sections and details.	5.	Specifications and/or general notes
fully describing demolition, materials and methods, testing and inspection
requirements.91.9516.3.  Engineer’s Statement.  (Amended by Ord. No.
179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  The responsible engineer shall state on
the approved plans, the following:	1.	“I am responsible for this building’s
seismic strengthening design in compliance with the minimum seismic resistance
standards of Division 95 of the Los Angeles Building Code.”	or when
applicable:	2.	“The Registered Deputy Inspector, required as a condition of
the use of structural design stresses requiring continuous inspection, will be
responsible to me as required by Section 91.1704 of the Los Angeles Building
Code.”TABLE 95-A
