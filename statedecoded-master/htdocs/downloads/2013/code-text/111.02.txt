SOUND LEVEL MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE AND CRITERIA. (§ 111.02)

  SOUND LEVEL MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE AND CRITERIA.
	(Title amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(a)	(Amended by Ord. No.
156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)  Any sound level measurement made pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter shall be measured with a sound level meter using the
“A” weighting and response as indicated in Section 111.01(k) of this
article.	Except when impractical, the microphone shall be located four to five
feet above the ground and ten feet or more from the nearest reflective
surface.  However, in those cases where another elevation is deemed
appropriated, the latter shall be utilized.	Interior sound level measurements
shall be made at a point at least four feet from the wall, ceiling, or floor
nearest the noise source.	Calibration of the sound level meter, utilizing an
acoustic calibrator shall be performed immediately prior to recording any sound
level data.  The ambient noise level and the level of a particular noise being
measured shall be the numerical average of noise measurements taken at a given
location during a given time period.	(b)	(Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff.
3/29/82.) Where the sound alleged to be offending is of a type or character set
forth below, the following values shall be added to the sound level measurement
of the offending noise:1.  	Except for noise emanating from any electrical
transformer or gas metering and pressure control equipment existing and
installed prior to the effective date of the ordinance enacting this chapter,
any steady tone with audible fundamental frequency or overtones have 200
Hz	+52.  Repeated impulsive noise	+53.  	Noise occurring more than 5 but less
than 15 minutes in any period of 60 consecutive minutes between the hours of
7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. of any day	-54.  Noise occurring five minutes or less
in any period of 60 consecutive minutes, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and
10:00 p.m. of any day	-5
	(Amended by Ord. No. 161,574, Eff. 9/8/86.)	(c)	For those cases where an
objectionable noise is clearly audible, but where the level of ambient noise
does not permit direct quantative sound level “A” measurements of the
objectionable noise, sound measurements may be performed utilizing an octave
band sound analyzer to determine sound level “A” limits as indicated in the
Table I below.  This table is used to convert the sound pressure level meter
readings in dB for each band to SPL in dB(A) for each band.TABLE I
