HEATING DIP TANK LIQUIDS. (§ 57.81.18)

  HEATING DIP TANK LIQUIDS.	When dip tank liquids are heated either by the
dipping of heated articles or by application of heat to the liquid, the
following controls shall be provided to prevent excessive temperature, vapor
accumulation, and autoignition:	A.	Dip tanks shall be equipped with an approved
manual-reset, excess temperature control unit designed to shut down the heating
and conveyor systems, if any, upon reaching such excess temperature.  Excess
temperature shall mean any temperature above which the required ventilation
system cannot safely handle generated vapors. In no case shall this temperature
exceed the boiling point, or come within 100°F. of the autoignition temperature
of the dip tank liquid.	B.	Heating and cooling units for liquids shall be of an
approved type and maintained in good repair.	C.	Parts shall not be dipped if
their surface temperature is within 100°F. of the autoignition temperature of
the dip tank liquid.
