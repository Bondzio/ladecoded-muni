	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code or any other ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, no permit or license shall be issued in violation of any provisions of this Code or any other ordinance of the City of Los Angeles; if any permit or license is issued in violation of any provision of this Code or any other ordinance of the City of Los Angeles the same shall be void.

&#xA0; INCONSISTENT PERMITS AND LICENSES.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 134,358, Eff. 6/8/67.)	Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Code or any other ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, no
