FEES FOR PERMIT. (§ 46.95)

  FEES FOR PERMIT.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 180,211, Eff. 11/7/08.)	(a)	A fee shall be charged for a
Tobacco Retailer’s Permit.  The permit fee will be recalculated annually and
approved by the City Council.  The permit fee shall be calculated so as not to
exceed the amount necessary to recover the cost of both the administration and
enforcement of the Tobacco Retailer’s Permit Program, including the costs of
issuing the permits, renewing the permits, administering the retailer permit
program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks,
documentation of violations, prosecution of violators, adjudications, and
convictions.  The permit fee for calendar year 2008 shall be $208.  The permit
fee for calendar year 2009 and thereafter shall be $300 until such fee is
recalculated and the revised fee is approved by the City Council.  All fees are
non-refundable, except as required by law, and shall be used exclusively to
reimburse the costs incurred for the program.  Fees shall not be prorated. 
All fees collected shall be deposited into the General Fund.	(b)	A $5.00 charge
shall be imposed for the issuance of a duplicate permit upon the permittee or an
authorized representative stating, in a properly executed affidavit of loss,
that the original permit has been lost or destroyed.  This charge shall be
deposited into the General Fund.
