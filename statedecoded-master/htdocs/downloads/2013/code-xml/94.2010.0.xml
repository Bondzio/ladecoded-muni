        Light
      
    
    
      
        Groups B, F, S and U Occupancies used for light manufacturing, commercial kitchens, laundries, automobile parking garages, bakeries, canneries, electronic plants, beverage manufacturing and glass products manufacturing plants not producing dust or fibers.&#xA0; In mixed occupancies housing group L occupancies, the portions of the building not classified as group L occupancy.&#xA0; Typically these uses are such that the quantity of combustibles is relatively low, the combustibility of contents is moderate, storage does not exceed 8 feet in height, and moderate-rate-of-heat-release fires would be expected.
      
      
        Ordinary

Group H Occupancies used as feed mills, tire manufacturing, chemical plants, repair garages and woodworking.&#xA0; Group H, Division 5 Occupancies, except storage rooms with dispensing.&#xA0; Research laboratories and similar areas of group L occupancy.

Chapter shall be used.	For hazard classification other than those indicated, see
appropriate nationally recognized standards for design criteria.	When fire
sprinkles systems are required in buildings of undetermined use, they shall be
designed and installed to have a sprinkler density of not less than that
required of an Ordinary Hazard Group 2 use with a minimum design area of 3,000
square feet. Use is considered undetermined if not specified at the time of
permit issued.	Where a subsequent occupancy requires a system with a greater
capability, it shall be the responsibility of the occupant and/or owner to
upgrade the system to the required density for the new occupancy.	5.1.3.1. Group
H, Division 5 Occupancies.&#xA0; Where the design area of the sprinklers system
consists of a corridor protected by one row of sprinklers, the maximum number of
sprinkler required to be calculated is 13.	5.1.3.2. Group L Occupancies.&#xA0;
Research laboratories and similar areas of group L occupancy shall not be less
than that required for Ordinary Hazard Group 2 with a design area of not less
