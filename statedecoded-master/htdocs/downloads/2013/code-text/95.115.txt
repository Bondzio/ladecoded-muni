trips when the job is of a type requiring an inspection before covering or
concealing the work.  On jobs which may be completely inspected on one
inspection trip, two inspection trips will be allowed.	EXCEPTION:  The number
of inspection trips will not be limited on progress jobs, provided, however,
that only one inspection will be permitted for checking a correction.  For the
purpose of this section, progress jobs are those in which circumstances beyond

recheck inspection.	4.	The fees charged under this section are in addition to
any other fees shown and the payment of the fees required by this section shall
not exempt any person from compliance with other provisions of this Code nor
from any penalty prescribed by law.	5.	Whenever special enforcement procedures
are required to obtain compliance with properly executed Department notices or
orders, a fee, as specified in Section 98.0407 of the Los Angeles Municipal
