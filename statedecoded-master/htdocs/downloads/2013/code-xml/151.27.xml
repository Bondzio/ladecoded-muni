	(Added by Ord. No. 177,901, Eff. 9/29/06.)

	If a landlord desires to offer for rent or lease a rental unit that was the subject of a Notice of Intent to Withdraw pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A. of Section 151.23, the following regulations apply:

	A.	A landlord who offers accommodations for rent or lease within two years from the date of withdrawal shall first offer to rent or lease each unit to the tenant or tenants displaced from that unit by the withdrawal, provided that the tenant or tenants advised the landlord in writing within 30 days of displacement of his or her desire to consider an offer to renew the tenancy, and provided the landlord with an address to which that offer is to be directed.&#xA0; That tenant or tenants may advise the landlord at any time during the period of eligibility of a change of address to which an offer is to be directed.

	If a landlord again offers accommodations for rent or lease pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, and the tenant or lessee has advised the landlord pursuant to this subsection of a desire to consider an offer to renew the tenancy, then the landlord shall offer to reinstitute a rental agreement or lease on terms permitted by law to that displaced tenant or lessee.

	A landlord who re-offers rental or lease accommodations to a previously displaced tenant pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall deposit the offer in the United States mail, by registered or certified mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the displaced tenant or tenants at the address furnished to the landlord as provided in this subsection, and shall describe the terms of the offer.&#xA0; The displaced tenant or tenants shall have 30 days from the deposit of the offer in the mail to accept the offer by personal delivery of that acceptance or by deposit of the acceptance in the United States mail by registered or certified mail with postage prepaid.

	B.	A landlord who offers accommodations for rent or lease not exceeding five years from the date of withdrawal shall first offer to rent or lease each unit to the tenant or tenants displaced from that accommodation by the withdrawal, provided that the tenant or tenants requests the offer in writing within 30 days after the landlord has notified the Department of an intention to offer the accommodations again for residential rent or lease pursuant to the requirements of Section 151.24.&#xA0; The landlord shall be liable to any tenant or tenants who were displaced by that action for failure to comply with this subsection, for punitive damages in an amount that does not exceed the contract rent for six months.&#xA0;</full_text><order_by>27</order_by><ancestry><unit id="38"
