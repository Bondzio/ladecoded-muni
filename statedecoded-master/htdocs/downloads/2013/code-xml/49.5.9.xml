	(Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 168,056, Eff. 8/8/92.)

	A.	Prohibition of Outside Earned Income &#x2013; Elected City Officers.&#xA0; Pursuant to Charter Section 218, the Mayor, City Attorney, Controller, and members of the City Council shall not receive any compensation, including honoraria, for their services other than that provided for by Charter Section 218, except that which may be provided for their serving on governmental entities where payment is authorized for other governmental officers or employees serving in such capacity.&#xA0; (Charter Section No. Amended by Ord. No. 172,942, Eff. 1/21/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)

	B.	Restrictions on Honoraria and Other Outside Earned Income &#x2013; Other Full Time City Officials and Employees.

	1.	Except as provided in Subsection A of this section, no full time City official shall accept any honoraria or other outside earned income without the prior written approval of the general manager or other chief administrative officer of his or her department, and, in the case of a source of income which the general manager or other chief administrative officer determines is a restricted source for that official, without the prior written approval of the City Ethics Commission.

	2.	The approval required by Subdivision 1 of this subsection shall be denied if the general manager, other chief administrative officer or City Ethics Commission determines that the receipt of the income would be inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with or inimical to the City official&#x2019;s official duties, functions or responsibilities.&#xA0; In so determining, the general manager, other chief administrative officer and City Ethics Commission shall consider whether one or more of the following factors is applicable:

	(a)	Whether the payment or the services for which the payment would be received creates the appearance of or involves actual use of public office or employment or the time, facilities, equipment or supplies of the official&#x2019;s agency, for private gain;

	(b)	Whether the payment or services for which the payment would be received involves the acceptance by the official of any money or other consideration from anyone other than his or her agency for the performance of an act which the official, if not performing such act for the outside source of income, would be required or expected to render in the regular course or hours of his or her duties as a City official;

	(c)	Whether the City official is in a position to make, to participate in making, or to influence a potential governmental decision that could foreseeably have a material financial effect on the source of income;

	(d)	Whether the payment or services for which the payment would be received involves the performance of any act in other than an official capacity which may later be subject, directly or indirectly, to the control, inspection, review, audit or enforcement of any other official of his or her agency;

	(e)	Whether the services involve such time demands that would render the official&#x2019;s performance or his or her official duties less efficient.

	3.	A request to the City Ethics Commission for approval pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as a request for written advice.

	4.	In the case of a request for approval by a member of the Board of Public Works or by any general manager or other chief administrative officer of any agency, the request shall be made to his or her appointing authority and, if required by Subdivision 1, to the City Ethics Commission.&#xA0; In the case of a request for approval by an employee of the office of a member of the City Council, the request shall be made to that member of the City Council and, if required by Subdivision 1, to the City Ethics Commission.</full_text><order_by>5.9</order_by><ancestry><unit id="93" label="article"><name>Municipal Ethics And Conflicts Of Interest</name><identifier>9.5</identifier><url>/4/9.5/</url></unit><unit id="11" label="chapter"><name>Public Welfare</name><identifier>4</identifier><url>/4/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="3582"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.1</section_number><catch_line>Title, Findings And Purposes.</catch_line><url>/49.5.1/</url><token>49.5.1</token></unit><unit id="1305"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.10</section_number><catch_line>Restrictions On Gifts And Travel Expenses.</catch_line><url>/49.5.10/</url><token>49.5.10</token></unit><unit id="1880"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.11</section_number><catch_line>Lobbying Activities Of Current And Former City Officials.</catch_line><url>/49.5.11/</url><token>49.5.11</token></unit><unit id="2267"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.12</section_number><catch_line>Future Employment Of City Officials.</catch_line><url>/49.5.12/</url><token>49.5.12</token></unit><unit id="3323"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.13</section_number><catch_line>Participation Of Elective City Officers And Employees In Governmental Decisions.</catch_line><url>/49.5.13/</url><token>49.5.13</token></unit><unit id="2435"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.14</section_number><catch_line>Application Of Requirements.</catch_line><url>/49.5.14/</url><token>49.5.14</token></unit><unit id="1460"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.15</section_number><catch_line>Contract Bidder And Proposer Disclosure &#x2013;
