GENERAL. (§ 161.801.1)

  GENERAL.
	(Added by Ord. No. 173,011, Eff. 1/30/00.)	Whenever a violation has not been
corrected by the time specified for compliance, the Manager shall hold a hearing
within 21 calendar days of the date specified for compliance.  If the hearing
does not occur within the time frame stated in this division, it does not remove
the obligation of the owner or other responsible parties to comply with any
orders or notices, nor does it limit the General Manager’s authority to issue
orders at the hearing.
