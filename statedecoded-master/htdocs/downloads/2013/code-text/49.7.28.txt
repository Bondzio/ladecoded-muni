REQUESTS FOR MATCHING FUNDS PAYMENTS. (§ 49.7.28)

  REQUESTS FOR MATCHING FUNDS PAYMENTS.	A.	A participating candidate may not
request a matching funds payment for less than $10,000 in qualified
contributions at any one time up to 14 days preceding an election.  Beginning
14 days before an election and ending on the last day to submit requests for
payment, as identified in Administrative Code Section 24.34 (c)(3), a
participating candidate may request a matching funds payment for $1,000 or more
in qualified contributions at any one time.	B.	Requests for matching funds
payments shall contain the information required by the Ethics Commission.	C.	A
candidate who makes a request for matching funds payment and knows or should
know that the request is false or that a contribution that forms the basis of
the request is misrepresented is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall return all
matching funds received as a result of the request.  If the candidate holds or
is elected to office, the false request constitutes a violation of official
duties and, if it is deemed appropriate by a court under Charter Section 207(c),
shall be removed from office.
