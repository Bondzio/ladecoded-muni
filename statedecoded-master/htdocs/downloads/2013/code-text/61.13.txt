IMPROVEMENT BOND PROCESSING FEE. (§ 61.13)

  IMPROVEMENT BOND PROCESSING FEE.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9/28/12.)	The Bureau of Engineering may
require a permit applicant to post a public improvement bond to guarantee that
improvements will be made in a public right-of-way or to protect or replace
existing improvements, and shall charge and collect a fee of $500 to process a
public improvement bond.  If necessary to avoid a bond default, the Bureau of
Engineering shall charge an additional fee of $420 to extend the bond or process
a replacement bond.  The Bureau of Engineering shall require all applicants for
a Class “B” permit to post a public improvement bond, and may also require a
permit applicant to post a bond when it determines that the project or activity
for which a permit is sought could damage existing public improvements.
