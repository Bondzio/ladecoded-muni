out–of–pocket expenses for labor and materials, administrative costs in an
amount equal to ten (10) percent of the reasonable cost actually incurred or
five hundred dollars ($500), whichever is greater. The amount of such costs for
which liability is imposed pursuant to this article shall be recoverable in a
civil action by the City or by ordinance and shall be in addition to any other
fees or penalties authorized by law, provided that any sums actually received by
the City in connection with such work pursuant to Chapter 6.8 (commencing with
Section 25300) of Division 20 of the Health and Safety Code shall be credited
against any amount recoverable in such civil action. If recovery of part or all
costs is by way of an ordinance the procedure set forth in LAAC § 19.96B.3
through 7, C.34 and D. shall be followed.
