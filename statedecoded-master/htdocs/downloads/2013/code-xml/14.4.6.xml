New Signs.&#xA0; No person shall erect, construct, install, paint, maintain, and no building or electrical permit shall be issued for, any sign or sign support structure within 2,000 feet of a freeway unless the Department of Building and Safety has first determined that the sign will not be viewed primarily from a main traveled roadway of a freeway or an on-ramp/off-ramp.&#xA0; However, at the termination of an off-ramp, any wall sign located along the front line may be viewed primarily from the off-ramp.

	The phrase &#x201C;viewed primarily from&#x201D; shall mean that the message may be seen with reasonable clarity for a greater distance by a person traveling on the main traveled roadway of a freeway or on-ramp/off-ramp than by a person traveling on the street adjacent to the sign.

	C.	Existing Signs.&#xA0; Within three years of the opening of a freeway to public travel, all signs that existed prior to the opening of the freeway and that are in conflict with the provisions of this section and/or Section 14.4.5 of this Code shall be removed, or shall be rearranged or relocated so as to eliminate any conflict with the provisions of this section and/or Section 14.4.5 of this Code.

	The Department of Building and Safety and the Department of Transportation shall determine whether or not the sign or sign support structure is in conflict with the provisions of this section and/or Section 14.4.5 of this Code.&#xA0; If it is determined that any sign or sign support structure is in conflict with any of the provisions of this section and/or Section 14.4.5 of this Code, then the permittee and/or other responsible person shall be advised and shall remove, rearrange or relocate the sign or sign support structure within this three-year period.

	D.
