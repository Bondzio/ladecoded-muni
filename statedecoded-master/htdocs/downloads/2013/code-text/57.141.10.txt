TESTING AND INSPECTION OF SYSTEMS. (§ 57.141.10)

  TESTING AND INSPECTION OF SYSTEMS.	A.	Every system shall be subjected to an
acceptance test which shall demonstrate that the system will perform as
intended.  At least semi-annually, all automatic fire extinguishing systems,
including alarms, shutdowns, and other associated equipment shall be thoroughly
inspected and serviced for proper operation.  This inspection shall include
determination of any changes in physical properties of the extinguishing agent
concentrate which indicate any deterioration in quality.	B.	When an inspection
by the Chief indicates there is substantial reason to believe that the automatic
fire extinguishing system would fail to operate, a functional and/or discharge
test shall be performed by competent personnel and witnessed by the
Chief.	C.	Maintenance inspection reports shall be filed with the owner or
owner’s agent and retained for five years.	D.	Semi-annually, all pressurized
cylinders shall be checked by pressure and/or weighed against the required
minimums.  If at any time a container shows a loss in net content weight of
more than five percent, or a drop in pressure of more than 10 percent of the
original weight or pressure, it shall be refilled or replaced.  The weight and
pressure of the container shall be recorded on a tag attached to the container.
