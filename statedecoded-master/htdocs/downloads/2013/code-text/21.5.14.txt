  COMMINGLED GOODS.	If the purchaser of fungible goods commingles such goods
with other fungible goods not so purchased but of such similarity that the
identity of the constituent goods in the commingled mass cannot be determined
and thereafter withdraws for use a part of such commingled goods, his
withdrawals shall be deemed to be from the goods not so purchased until a
quantity of commingled goods equal to the quantity of goods not so purchased but
so commingled has been withdrawn.
