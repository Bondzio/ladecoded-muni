  PRESENTATION OF BADGE AS A MEMORIAL TO REGULAR FIRE DEPARTMENT MEMBER KILLED
IN THE LINE OF DUTY.	A.	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article,
the Board of Fire Commissioners may:	1.	Cause a member’s badge and number to
be retired from active service and use.	2.	Cause the badge, or a similar badge,
to be presented to the deceased member’s surviving spouse, child, or person in
the member’s immediate family, as a memorial honoring the member.	B.	Prior to
the presentation, the Board shall cause the badge to be affixed permanently to a
plaque or within a frame, which will effectively preclude improper use of the
badge, with a statement clearly visible showing the member’s death in the line
of duty.	C.	No person shall remove from the plaque or frame any badge presented
under this section, or wear such a badge, or display it, except while it is
attached to the plaque or within the frame, with the above-prescribed statement
clearly visible. Any badge removed, worn, or displayed in violation of this
subsection shall be subject to confiscation by the Board.
