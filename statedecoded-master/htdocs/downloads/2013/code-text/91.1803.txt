  GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATION.
	(Added by Ord. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)	Section 1803 of the CBC is adopted by
reference, except Section 1803.5.6 of the CBC is not adopted and in lieu Section
91.1803.5.6 is added.91.1803.5.6. Rock Strata.  Where subsurface explorations
at the project site indicate variations or doubtful characteristics in the
structure of the rock upon which foundations are to be constructed, a sufficient
number of borings shall be made to a depth of not less than ten feet (3048 mm)
below the level of the foundations and to a depth that would allow investigation
of any unsupported bedding planes or any other rock discontinuities that could
influence the foundation stability to provide assurance of the soundness of the
foundation bed and its load-bearing capacity.
