TWENTY PERCENT SAVINGS. (§ 99.04.303)

99.04.303.1.    A schedule of plumbing fixtures and fixture fittings that will
reduce the overall use of potable water within the building by at least 20
percent shall be provided.  The reduction shall be based on the maximum
allowable water use per plumbing fixture and fitting as required by the
California Building Standards Code.  The 20 percent reduction in potable water
use shall be demonstrated by one of the following methods:	1.	Each plumbing
fixture and fitting shall meet reduced flow rates specified in Table 4.303.2;
or	2.	A calculation demonstrating a 20 percent reduction in the building
“water use” baseline as established in Table 4.303.1 shall be provided. 
For low-rise residential occupancies, the calculation shall be limited to the
following plumbing fixture and fitting types: water closets, urinals, lavatory
faucets, kitchen faucets and showerheads.TABLE 4.303.1

  Fixture “Water Use” = Flow rate x Duration x Occupants x Daily uses 
1	Use Worksheet WS-1 to calculate baseline water use.
  2	The Flow-rate is from the CEC Appliance Efficiency Standards, Title 20,
California Code of Regulations; where a conflict occurs, the CEC standards shall
apply.
  3	For low rise residential occupancies, the number of occupants shall be
based on two persons for the first bedroom, plus one additional person for each
additional bedroom.
  4	The daily use number shall be increased to three if urinals are not
installed in the room.99.04.303.2.  Multiple Showerheads Serving One Shower. 
When single shower fixtures are served by more than one showerhead, the combined
flow rate of all the showerheads shall not exceed the maximum flow rates
specified in the 20 percent reduction column contained in Table 4.303.2 or the
shower shall be designed to only allow one showerhead to be in operation at a
time.	EXCEPTION: The maximum flow rate for showerheads when using the
calculation method specified in Section 99.04.303.1, Item 2, is 2.5 gpm @ 80
