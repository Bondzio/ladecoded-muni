TEN-YEAR INSPECTION. (§ 57.40.26)

  TEN-YEAR INSPECTION.	After a gasholder has been in service for a period not
to exceed 10 years, and at intervals not exceeding 10 years thereafter, a
complete and thorough external inspection shall be made and reported upon by
qualified persons.	If, as a result of the external inspection, the inspector
certifies that the condition of the gasholder is such that an internal
inspection is advisable, the gasholder shall be removed from service and a
complete and thorough internal inspection made.	The person or persons making
such inspections shall submit a complete report of the condition of the
gasholder to the owner of the gasholder and at the same time forward a copy to
the Fire Department’s Bureau of Fire Prevention.	The provisions of this
section shall not apply to gasholders owned and operated by public utilities.
Such gasholders are inspected in accordance with the requirements of the Public
Utilities Commission of the State of California.
