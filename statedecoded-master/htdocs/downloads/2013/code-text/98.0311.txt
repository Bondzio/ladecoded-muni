DEFAULTS AND UNCONTESTED CASES. (§ 98.0311)

  DEFAULTS AND UNCONTESTED CASES.	If the respondent files a notice of defense
admitting all parts of the accusation, or fails to file a notice of defense or
fails to appear at the hearing, the Superintendent may take action based on the
respondent’s express admissions or upon other evidence, including official
reports, except that where the burden of proof is on the respondent to establish
that he is entitled to the action sought, the Superintendent may act without
taking evidence. Nothing herein shall be construed to deprive the respondent of
the right to make any showing by way of mitigation.  (Amended by Ord. No.
139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)
