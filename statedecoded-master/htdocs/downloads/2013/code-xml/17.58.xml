	(Added by Ord. No. 147,650, Eff. 10/11/75.)

	A.	No Final Parcel Map shall be accepted by the City Council or filed with the County Recorder unless in connection therewith land has been dedicated or a fee has been paid in lieu thereof, or some combination of dedication and payment has occurred, as may be determined by the Advisory Agency, in accordance with the standards and in a manner set forth in Section 17.12 of this Code.

	B.	Exemptions. In addition to the exemptions and credits provided for in Section 17.12 of this Code, no land shall be required to be dedicated, and no fees shall be required to be paid when the Advisory Agency determines that any of the following conditions exist:

	1.	The filing of the Parcel Map is merely to adjust lot lines between existing lots.

	2.	The filing of the Parcel Map will result in reducing the number of existing lots.

	3.	The Parcel Map is filed to obtain Private Street approval to serve an existing legal lot, and will not create additional building sites.

	4.	The Parcel Map is filed to allow conversion of an existing residential structure, more than 5 years old to condominium use, without increasing the number of dwelling units.

	5.	The Parcel Map is filed for the purpose of vacating a public easement, unless the City Council in connection with such vacation proceedings requires the dedication of land or the payment of fees pursuant to Section 17.12 of this Code.

	C.	Further Exemptions. In addition to the exemptions above, no land shall be required to be dedicated, and no fees shall be required to be paid as to any portion of a parcel map where the Advisory Agency determines that:

	1.	The property is so zoned that no residential uses are permitted thereon, or such parcel or parcels are not to be used for residential purposes. Provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years, the fee provided for in Section 17.12 of this Code shall be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such building permit.

	2.	Any proposed parcel or parcels are improved with existing residential structures. In the event, however, that a further increase in density is permitted by the existing zoning regulations, the owner thereof shall execute and record in the office of the County Recorder a covenant running with the land and binding upon all future owners of the property which has been approved by the Department of City Planning, that said property will not be increased in density by further residential development unless the required dedication of land, or the payment of fees has been made pursuant to Section 17.12 of this Code, prior to the issuance of building permits.</full_text><order_by>58</order_by><ancestry><unit id="8" label="article"><name>Division Of Land Regulations</name><identifier>7</identifier><url>/1/7/</url></unit><unit id="7" label="chapter"><name>General Provisions and Zoning</name><identifier>1</identifier><url>/1/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="2702"><structure_id>8</structure_id><section_number>17.00</section_number><catch_line>Title.</catch_line><url>/17.00/</url><token>17.00</token></unit><unit id="395"><structure_id>8</structure_id><section_number>17.01</section_number><catch_line>Tract Maps &#x2013;
