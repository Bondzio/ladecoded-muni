  DEFINITIONS.	Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, the words and
phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows:	(a)	“Ambient Noise” is
the composite of noise from all sources near and far in a given environment,
exclusive of occasional and transient intrusive noise sources and of the
particular noise source or sources to be measured. Ambient noise shall be
averaged over a period of at least 15 minutes at a location and time of day
comparable to that during which the measurement is taken of the particular noise
source being measured. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff.
3/29/82.)	(b)	“Commercial Purpose” is the use, operation, or maintenance of
any sound amplifying equipment for the purpose of advertising any business,
goods, or services, or for the purpose of attracting the attention of the public
to, advertising for, or soliciting patronage or customers to or for any
performance, show, entertainment, exhibition, or event, or for the purpose of
demonstrating such sound equipment. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff.
3/29/82.)	(c)	“Decibel” (dB) is a unit of level which denotes the ratio
between two (2) quantities which are proportional to power; the number of
decibels corresponding to the ratio of two (2) amounts of power is ten (10)
times the logarithm to the base (10) of this ratio. (Amended by Ord. No.
156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(d)	“Emergency Work” is work made necessary to
restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity or work
required to protect persons or property from an imminent exposure to danger, or
work by private or public utilities when restoring utility service. (Amended by
Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(e)	“Impulsive Sound” is sound of short
duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. By
way of example “impulsive sound” shall include, but shall not be limited to,
explosions, musical base drum beats, or the discharge of firearms. (Amended by
Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(f)	“Motor Vehicle” includes, but shall not
be limited to, automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, minibikes and go-carts.
(Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(g)	“Noncommercial Purpose” is
the use, operation, or maintenance of any sound equipment for other than a
“commercial purpose”. “Noncommercial purpose” shall mean and include,
but shall not be limited to, philanthropic, political, patriotic, and charitable
purposes. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(h)	“Octave Band Noise
Analyzer” is an instrument for measurement of sound levels in octave frequency
bands which satisfies the pertinent requirements for Class II octave band
analyzers of the American National Standard Specifications for Octave,
Half-Octave, and Third-Octave Band Filters, S1.11-1966 or the most recent
revision thereof. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(i)	“Person”
is a person, firm, association, co-partnership, joint venture, corporation, or
any entity, private or public in nature. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff.
3/29/82.)	(j)	“Sound Amplifying Equipment” (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363,
Eff. 3/29/82.) is any machine or device for the amplification of the human
voice, music or any other sound, but shall not include:	1.	Automobile radios,
stereo players or television receivers when used and heard only by the occupants
of the vehicle in which the same is installed.	2.	Radio, stereo players,
phonographs or television receivers used in any house or apartment within any
residential zone or within 500 feet thereof.
	3.	Warning devices on emergency vehicles.	4.	Horns or other warning devices
authorized by law on any vehicle when used for traffic purposes.	(k)	“Sound
Level” (Noise level) in decibels (dB) is the sound measured with the “A”
weighting and slow responses by a sound level meter; except for impulsive or
rapidly varying sounds, the fast response shall be used. (Amended by Ord. No.
156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(l)	“Sound Level Meter” is an instrument including a
microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and “A” frequency weighting
network for the measurement of sound levels which satisfies the pertinent
requirements for Type S2A meters in American Standard Specifications for sound
level meters in S1.4-1971 or the most recent revision thereof. (Amended by Ord.
No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)	(m)	“Sound Truck” is any motor vehicle, or any
other vehicle regardless of motive power, whether in motion or stationary, which
carries, is equipped with, or which has mounted thereon, or attached thereto,
any sound amplifying equipment. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff.
3/29/82.)	(n)	Supplementary of Technical Terms.  Definitions of technical terms
not defined herein shall be obtained from American Standard Acoustical
