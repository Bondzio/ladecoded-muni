No. 179,324, Eff. 12\/10\/07, Oper. 1\/1\/08.)\u00a0 The seismic ground motion values shall be determined in accordance with ASCE 7 and may be one of the following:\n\n\t1.\tThe elastic design response spectrum shall be 75% of the response spectrum described in Section 11.4.5 of ASCE 7.\n\n\t2.\tA site-specific response spectrum shall be 75% of the site-specific response spectrum described in Section 11.4.7 of ASCE 7.\n\n91.9509.3.\u00a0 Mathematical Model.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12\/10\/07, Oper. 1\/1\/08.)\u00a0 The three- dimensional mathematical model of the physical structure shall represent the spatial distribution of mass and stiffness of the structure to an extent that is adequate for the calculation of the significant features of its dynamic response.\u00a0 All concrete and masonry elements shall be included in the model of the physical structure.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 Concrete or masonry partitions that are adequately isolated from the concrete frame members and the floor above.\n\n\tCast-in-place reinforced concrete floors with span-to- depth ratios less than 3:1 may be assumed to be rigid diaphragms.\u00a0 Other floors, including floors constructed of precast elements with or without a reinforced concrete topping, shall be analyzed in conformance with Section 12.3.1.3 of ASCE 7 to determine if they must be considered as flexible diaphragms.\u00a0 The effective in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm, including effects of cracking and discontinuity between precast elements shall be considered.\u00a0 Ramps that interconnect floor levels shall be modeled as having mass appropriately distributed on that element.\u00a0 The lateral stiffness of the ramp may be calculated as having properties based on the uncracked cross section of the slab exclusive of beams and girders.\n\n91.9509.4.\u00a0 Effective Stiffness.\n\n91.9509.4.1.\u00a0 General.\u00a0 The effective stiffness of concrete and masonry elements or systems shall be calculated as the secant stiffness of the element or system with due consideration of the effects of tensile cracking and compression strain.\u00a0 The secant stiffness shall be taken from the force-displacement relationship of the element or system.\u00a0 The secant

spectrum analysis is an elastic dynamic analysis of a structure utilizing the peak dynamic response of all modes having a significant contribution to total structural response.\u00a0 Peak modal responses are calculated using the ordinates of the appropriate response spectrum curve which correspond to the modal periods.\u00a0 Maximum modal contributions are combined in a statistical manner to obtain an approximate total structural response.\n\n91.9509.5.2.\u00a0 Number of Modes.\u00a0 The requirement of Section 91.9509.5.1 may be satisfied by demonstrating that for the modes considered, at

stress-strain relationship of concrete, masonry and reinforcement shall be determined by testing or from published data.\u00a0 The procedure for testing and determination of stress-strain values shall be as prescribed in one of the following:\n\n\tA.\tConcrete.\u00a0 The compressive strength of existing concrete shall be determined by tests on cores sampled from the structure or may be taken from information given on the construction documents and confirmed by limited testing.\u00a0 A default value of horizontal shear stress may be used in Section 91.9511.5.1 without testing of the compressive strength of the existing concrete.\n\n\t1.\tThe cutting of cores shall not significantly reduce the strength of the existing structure.\u00a0 Cores shall not be taken in columns.\u00a0 Existing reinforcement shall not be cut.\n\n\t2.\tIf the construction documents do not specify a minimum compressive strength of the classes of concrete, five cores per story, with a minimum of ten cores, shall be obtained for testing.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 If the coefficient of variation of the compressive strength does not exceed 15 percent, the number of cores per story may be reduced to two and the minimum number of tests reduced to five.\n\n\t3.\tWhen the construction documents specify a minimum compressive strength, two cores per story, per class of concrete, shall be taken in the areas where that concrete was to be placed.\u00a0 A minimum of five cores shall be obtained for testing.\u00a0 If a higher strength of concrete was specified for columns than the remainder of the concrete, cores taken in the beams for verification of the specified strength of the beams, shall be substituted for tests in the columns.\u00a0 The strength specified for columns may be used in the analyses if the specified compressive strength in the beams is verified.\n\n\t4.\tThe sampling for the concrete strength tests shall be distributed uniformly in each story.\u00a0 If the building has shear walls, a minimum of 50 percent of the cores shall be taken from the shear walls.\u00a0 Not more than 25 percent of the required cores shall be taken in floor and roof slabs.\u00a0 The remainder of cores may be taken from the center of beams at mid-span.\u00a0 In concrete frame buildings, 75 percent of the cores shall be taken from the beams.\n\n\t5.\tThe mean value of the compressive stresses obtained from the core testing for each class of concrete shall be used in the analyses.\u00a0 Values of peak strain that is associated with peak compressive stress may be taken from published data for the nonlinear analyses of reinforced concrete elements.\n\n\tB.\tSolid Grouted Reinforced Masonry.\u00a0 The compressive strength of solid grouted concrete block or brick masonry may be taken as 2000 psi (13.8 MPa).\u00a0 The strain associated with peak stress may be taken as 0.0025.\n\n\tC.\tPartially Grouted Masonry.\u00a0 A minimum of five units shall be removed from the walls and tested in conformance with ASTM C 140.\u00a0 Compressive strength of the masonry may be determined in accordance with CBC Section 2105.2.2, assuming Type S mortar.\u00a0 The strain associated with peak stress

testing.\u00a0 The test procedure shall conform to Section 91.9513.\n\n\t2.\tOne stress-strain test per story and a minimum of five tests shall be made in the unreinforced masonry infills.\u00a0 The location of the tests shall be uniformly distributed throughout the building.\n\n\t3.\tThe average values of the stress-strain values obtained from testing shall be used in the nonlinear analyses of frame-infill assemblies or in the calculation of the effective diagonal brace that is used in the simplified analysis procedure of Section 91.9511.\n\n\tE.\tReinforcement.\u00a0 The yield stress of each type of new or existing reinforcement shall be taken from Table 95-E unless the reinforcement is sampled and tested for yield stress.\u00a0 The axial reinforcement in columns of post-1933 buildings shall be assumed to be hard grade unless noted otherwise on the construction documents.\n\n\tF.\tCombination of Concrete and Masonry Materials.\u00a0 Combinations of masonry and concrete infills shall be assumed to have equal strain.\u00a0 The secant moduli at peak stress of the masonry and concrete shall be used to determine the effective transformed area of the composite material.\n\n91.9509.7.\u00a0 Story Drift Limitation.\n\n91.9509.7.1.\u00a0 Definition.\u00a0 Story drift is the displacement of one level relative to the level above or below calculated by the response spectrum analysis using the appropriate effective stiffness.\n\n91.9509.7.2.\u00a0 Limitation.\u00a0 The story drift is limited to that displacement that causes any of the following effects:\n\n\t1.\tCompressive strain of 0.003 in the frame confining infill or in a shear wall.\n\n\t2.\tCompressive strain of 0.004 in a reinforced concrete column unless the engineer can show by published experimental research that the existing confinement reinforcement justifies higher values of strain.\n\n\t3.\tPeak strain in masonry infills as determined by experimental data or by physical testing as prescribed in Section 91.9513.\n\n\t4.\tDisplacement that was calculated by the nonlinear analysis as when strength degradation of any element began.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 Item 4 may be taken as the displacement that causes a strength degradation in that line of resistance equal to 10 percent of the sum of the strength of the elements in that line of resistance.\n\n\t5.\tA story drift of 0.015 using the dynamic analysis procedure or the forces specified in Section 91.9510.\u00a0 This limitation shall not supersede the limitations of Items 1-4.\n\n91.9509.8.\u00a0 Compressive Strain Determination.\n\n91.9509.8.1.\u00a0 General.\u00a0 The compressive strain in columns, shear walls and infills may be determined by the nonlinear analysis or a procedure that assumes plane sections remain plane.\n\n91.9509.8.2.\u00a0 Axial and Flexural Loading.\u00a0 The compressive strain shall be determined for combined flexure and axial loading.\u00a0 The flexural moments shall be taken from the response spectrum model for frame or shear wall buildings, and from the substructure model for infill frames.\u00a0 The axial loads shall have the following combination of effects, where L is unreduced live load:\n\nU = 1.0 D + 0.3 L = 1.0 E\t(9-4)\n\nU = 0.9 D\u00a0 -\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 E\t(9-5)\n\n91.9509.9.\u00a0 Shear Strength Limitation.\u00a0 The required in-plane shear strength of all columns, piers and shear walls shall be the shear associated with the moments induced at the ends of columns or piers and at the base of shear walls by the story displacements.\u00a0
