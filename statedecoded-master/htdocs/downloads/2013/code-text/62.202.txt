IMPORT AND EXPORT OF EARTH MATERIALS – BONDED REQUIREMENT. (§ 62.202)

  IMPORT AND EXPORT OF EARTH MATERIALS – BONDED REQUIREMENT.
	(Added by Ord. No. 148,167, Eff. 5/3/76.)	The Department of Public Works may
require a bond as a condition of a grading permit involving the import or export
of more than 100 cubic yards of earth materials within a hillside area. Any such
bond shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney, executed by the permittee
and a corporate surety authorized to do business in this state in an amount
sufficient to cover the cost of repair of any damage to the public streets and
any public facilities therein and the cost of removal of any earth materials or
other debris deposited therein, reasonably expected to result from the
permittee’s operations. The conditions of the bond shall guarantee payment to
the City for all costs and expense in repairing the damaged streets or other
public facilities and the removal of any deposits of earth materials or other
debris resulting from the permitted operations. In lieu of a surety bond, the
permittee may file a cash bond with the Department upon the same terms and
conditions and in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety
bond. The deposit submitted may be in the form of cash or negotiable United
States securities. The term of such bond shall begin on the date of filing and
shall remain in effect until the completion of the hauling operations and
subsequent inspection of the affected public streets by the Department of Public
Works.
