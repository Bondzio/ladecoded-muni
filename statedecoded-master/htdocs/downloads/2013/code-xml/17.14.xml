	E.	(Added by Ord. No. 163,641, Eff. 7/1/88.) Modifications and amending maps shall be governed by the following limitations.

	2.	No condition may be modified if it was imposed as a mitigating measure identified in a mitigated or conditional negative declaration or in an Environmental Impact Report.

	3.	Modifications involving increases in density over that originally approved by the Advisory Agency in approving the tentative map shall be limited as follows:

	(b)	an increase in the elevation of building pads of not more than 5 feet above the approved elevation of such pads.

	Any such increase in height or elevation shall not obstruct the view from surrounding properties. A greater increase in the elevation of building pads may be approved if such increase has been determined to be necessary for health and safety reasons by the Department of Building an Safety.

	5.	No modifications shall be permitted which violate the intent of any of the original conditions of the tract map approval as that intent is expressed in the findings or otherwise by the decision maker.

	F.	An amending map or certificate of correction shall be recorded with the Office of the County Recorder in the manner specified in Government Code Section 66472. If the modification of one or more conditions does not require an amending map or certificate of correction, the approval of the modification shall be evidenced in a letter mailed to the subdivider and made a part of the subject tract file.
