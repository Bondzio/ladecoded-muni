PERMIT REQUIRED FROM BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. (§ 68.02)

  PERMIT REQUIRED FROM BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.	No person shall install or
maintain any bench on any street without a permit therefor from the Board of
Public Works. A separate permit shall be obtained for each bench, which permit
shall be valid only for the particular location specified therein. Each permit
shall bear a separate number and not more than two permits shall be issued for
any one location.	Where bus stop changes are authorized by the Department of
Transportation, the permit and bench may be transferred to another location at
the same intersection upon the payment of a transfer fee. When the bus stop is
moved on a temporary basis, the permit and bench may be transferred to another
location at the same intersection without an additional fee or permit upon
condition that the bench and permit be restored to its original location as soon
as practicable. The Department of Public Works shall be notified of such
change.  (Amended by Ord. No. 152,426, Eff. 6/29/79.)
