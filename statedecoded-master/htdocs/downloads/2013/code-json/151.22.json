No. 177,901, Eff. 9\/29\/06.)\n\n\tCalifornia Government Code Sections 7060, et seq. (the \u201cEllis Act\u201d) permits the City, among other things, to require landlords to provide all tenants with 120 days notice, or one year if the tenants lived in the accommodations for at least one year and are more than 62 years of age or disabled, when rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance are to be withdrawn from the rental market.\u00a0 The Ellis Act also permits the City to impose other restrictions, conditions and requirements upon the property.\u00a0 It is the purpose of this section, and Sections 151.23 through 151.28, to implement provisions of the Ellis Act.\u00a0 The Department may develop forms and regulations to assist in the implementation of these provisions.\n\n\tThere continues to be a low vacancy rate for rental units in the City of Los Angeles, and the withdrawal of residential rental property from rent or lease will exacerbate the rental housing shortage and make it more difficult for tenants displaced by the withdrawal to obtain replacement housing.\u00a0 Because of the rental housing shortage, it is essential that tenants be afforded substantial advance notice to enable them to obtain replacement housing, and that they receive other protections available under law.\n\n\tIn any action by a landlord to recover possession of a rental unit subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, the tenant may raise as an affirmative defense the failure of the landlord to comply with the requirements of Sections 151.22 through 151.28, as well as the failure of the landlord to comply with any other requirement of this chapter.","order_by":"22","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"38","name":"Rent Stabilization Ordinance","identifier":"1","label":"article","url":"\/15\/1\/"},"2":{"id":"37","name":"Rent Stabilization
