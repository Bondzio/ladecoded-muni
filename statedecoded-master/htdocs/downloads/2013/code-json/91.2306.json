Wood Structural Panel Diaphragms.\u00a0 Wood structural panel diaphragms shall be designed and constructed in accordance with AF&#038;PA SDPWS. Wood structural panel diaphragms are permitted to resist horizontal forces using the allowable shear capacities set forth in CBC Table 2306.2.1(1) or CBC Table 2306.2.1(2). For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F, the allowable shear capacities shall be set forth in Table 2306.2.1(3) or 2306.2.1(4). The allowable shear capacities in CBC Table 2306.2.1(1) or CBC 2306.2.1(2) are permitted to be increased 40 percent for wind design.\n\n\tWood structural panel diaphragms fastened with staples shall not be used to resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 Staples may be used for wood structural panel diaphragms when the allowable shear values are substantiated by cyclic testing and approved by the building official.\n\n\tWood structural panel diaphragms used to resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic Design
