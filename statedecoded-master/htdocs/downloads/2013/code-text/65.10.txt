APPEAL FROM ORDER. (§ 65.10)

  APPEAL FROM ORDER.	Any person served with an order to repair may, at any time
prior to the date specified in the order for the work to be commenced, file a
written appeal to the Board of Public Works, upon such form as the Board shall
prescribe, for a review of any of the requirements of said order. The filing of
such an appeal shall stay all requirements of the order until a determination of
the matter is rendered by the Board. The Board shall promptly set a date for the
hearing of the appeal and shall at least 10 days prior thereto, serve and post
notice of the date thereof in the manner, prescribed by Sections 65.05, 65.06
and 65.07. The Board shall make such investigations as it deems necessary and
shall upon the date set for hearing of the appeal from the order to repair, hear
and consider evidence offered by any interested person. Thereafter, but in no
event later than 45 days from receipt of the appeal, the Board shall make
written findings of fact as to whether or not the private street is a hazardous
private street within the terms of this division, and may affirm, change or
modify any of the requirements of the repair order.
