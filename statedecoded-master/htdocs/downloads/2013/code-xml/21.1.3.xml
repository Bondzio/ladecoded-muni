	(h)	If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the service supplier or taxpayer reasonably identifies actual charges for services not subject to the tax.&#xA0; The service supplier or taxpayer seeking a reduction has the burden of proving the proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges based upon books and records that are kept in the regular course of business and in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

(h)	If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the service supplier or taxpayer reasonably identifies actual charges for services not subject to the tax.&#xA0; The service supplier or taxpayer seeking a reduction has the burden of proving the proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges based upon books and records that are kept in the regular course of business and in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.* Note: Pursuant to the passage of Proposition S in a Special Election held on February 5, 2008, Ordinance No. 179,686 was adopted by the Council of the City of Los Angeles at its meeting of March 5, 2008.</text><type>section</type><prefixes><unit></unit></prefixes><entire_prefix></entire_prefix><prefix_anchor></prefix_anchor><level>1</level></unit></text></law>
