	A.	No sanitary landfill shall be operated without first obtaining a permit from the Department.&#xA0; An application shall be filed with the Department giving information as required by the Department.

	B.	It shall be unlawful to burn or incinerate solid waste or rubbish on private or public property or upon sanitary landfills within the City of Los Angeles.&#xA0; This Subsection does not apply to transformation or conversion technology facilities (e.g., waste-to-energy facilities that generate electricity through the incineration of solid waste, or other transformation facilities as defined by the California Public Resources Code) that have obtained all necessary permits to operate.

	C.	Prior to the issuance of a permit, the Department shall investigate each particular site and shall require that all necessary measures be taken to ensure that the operation of the sanitary landfill will not endanger the public health, safety or welfare and that it conforms to requirements for solid waste facilities found in the California Integrated Solid Waste Management Act of 1989 commencing with Section 40000 of the Public Resources Code and the California Code of Regulations Title 27, Division 2 or any successor statutes.

	D.	The definition of solid waste facilities for establishing fees is as follows:

	1.	Class A Landfill &#x2013; A municipal solid waste landfill as defined in Title 27, Division 2, Chapter 3 in the California Code of Regulations that has been issued a solid waste facility permit.

	2.	Class A-2 Landfill &#x2013; A municipal solid waste landfill as defined in Title 27, Division 2, Chapter 3 in the California Code of Regulations that has been issued a solid waste facility permit and due to specific site conditions requires special monitoring of both the active and closed units of the landfill.

	3.	Class B Landfill &#x2013; A landfill that has ceased accepting waste and that has closure documentation and is under review and evaluation by the Department.

	4.	Class C Landfill &#x2013; A landfill that has ceased accepting waste, has had closure documentation that has been approved and is implementing the final closure plan.

	5.	Class D Landfill &#x2013; A landfill that has ceased accepting waste and has completed closure in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations and local ordinances in effect at the time and meets either of the following conditions:

	(a)	Environmental impacts such as landfill gas or leachate are not being mitigated, either on or off site, to protect public health and/or the environment.&#xA0; At least monthly inspections by the Department are required.

	(b)	Environmental impacts such as landfill gas or leachate are being mitigated on site to protect public health and/or the environment.&#xA0; However, control systems require at least monthly monitoring by the Department due to the proximity of sensitive receptors, such as structures.&#xA0; Regular monitoring reports also may be required to be submitted to the Department for review on a regular basis.

	6.	Class E Landfill &#x2013; A landfill that has ceased accepting waste and has completed closure in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations and local ordinances in effect at the time of closure and meets either of the following conditions:

	(b)	Environmental impacts such as landfill gas or leachate are being mitigated on site to protect public health and/or the environment, however due to the proximity of sensitive receptors such as structures, inspection is required more than quarterly, but less than monthly.

	7.	Class F Landfill &#x2013; A landfill that has ceased accepting waste and has completed closure in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations and local ordinances in effect at the time.&#xA0; Due to site conditions including, but not limited to, minimal gas and leachate production, and distant proximity to sensitive receptors, only quarterly inspections are required.

	8.	Class G Landfill &#x2013; A landfill that is permitted to accept only inert solids or inert waste materials including, but not limited to, soil and concrete, that does not contain hazardous waste or soluble pollutants at concentrations in excess of water-quality objectives established by a Regional Water Quality Control Board pursuant to Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000) of the California Water Code and does not contain significant quantities of decomposable solid waste.

	E.	A permit shall not extend to a date later than the last day of the paid permit period.&#xA0; The permit may be renewed annually by the Department, upon the receipt of payment of fees contained in this ordinance.&#xA0; Fees for a new permit issued after the first day of July will be prorated on a monthly basis.

	F.	The Department shall enforce the California Integrated Solid Waste Management Act of 1989 commencing with Section 40000 et seq. of the Public Resources Code and the California Code of Regulations Title 14 and Title 27, governing the sanitary landfill administrative, operational, and closure/post-closure requirements.

	G.
