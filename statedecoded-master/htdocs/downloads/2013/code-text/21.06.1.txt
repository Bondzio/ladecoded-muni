SINGLE PRIMARY TAX CLASSIFICATION ELECTION. (§ 21.06.1)

  SINGLE PRIMARY TAX CLASSIFICATION ELECTION.
	(Added by Ord. No. 175,385, Eff. 9/14/03, Oper. 1/1/04.)	(a)	When a person
engages in a business that consists of two or more activities taxable on the
basis of annual gross receipts and one of the activities generates at least 80%
of the person’s annual taxable gross receipts, that person may elect on a
yearly basis to have all of its taxable annual gross receipts reported and taxed
at the rate applicable to the activity constituting at least 80% of annual
taxable receipts.	Any business activities taxed other than on the basis of
annual gross receipts shall not be combined with business activities taxed on
the basis of annual gross receipts, and the receipts generated by the activities
taxed other than on the basis of annual gross receipts shall continue to be
taxed under the existing tax sections and shall be excluded in computing the 80%
threshold.  	The provisions of this section shall only apply to gross receipts
generated by business activities conducted at or originating from the same
location or as otherwise provided for under Section 21.06.  All apportionments
shall be made prior to electing the single primary tax classification using the
appropriate apportionment formulas for each classification.   	(b)  Any tax
deficiency or delinquency resulting from an election and payment made pursuant
to Subsection (a) in which the primary tax category does not meet the 80%
threshold shall accrue interest and penalties as set forth in Section 21.05 of
this Article.
