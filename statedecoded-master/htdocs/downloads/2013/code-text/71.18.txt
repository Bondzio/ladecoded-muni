  PERMITTED VEHICLE ZONES.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,901, Eff. 5/31/01.)	(a)	The Department may establish
zones to be used for the parking of vehicles defined in Section 71.00, or
operated in passenger transportation service by authority of the California
Public Utilities Commission, while awaiting employment.	(b)	Any zone so
designated shall be occupied only by the permittee or permittees so authorized
where such zone has been established in accordance with the provisions herein
contained, and shall be occupied only during such hours of the day as may be
specified by said Department.	(c)	All existing and future taxicab zones
established in the City shall be open to use by all taxicab operators franchised

taxicab zones.  The Board may, after public hearing, determine that public
interest requires that one or more taxicab operators be restricted or prohibited
from the use of any specified zone.
