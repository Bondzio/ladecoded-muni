PURGING OF GASHOLDERS. (§ 57.40.23)

  PURGING OF GASHOLDERS.	A.	Before work is performed on any gasholder which
contains flammable or toxic gas, such as removing from service for internal
inspection, internal repairs, or dismantling, all inlet and outlet gas
connecting piping except those opening to the atmosphere, shall be physically
removed or properly blanked off and the vessels purged. The closing of inlet and
outlet valves is not compliance herewith.	B.	Before workmen are allowed to enter
a gasholder removed from service and purged with inert gas, the inert gas shall
be purged with air. While the interior of a purged gasholder is being worked on,
a continuous and adequate circulation of outside air shall be maintained through
the gasholder by means of fans or other devices.	The above requirements shall
not be necessary with workmen using self-contained breathing apparatus or
supplied-air hose masks.	C.	Upon returning a purged gasholder to service, the
air shall be purged therefrom with inert gases before any flammable gas having a
flammable range greater than 25 percent is allowed to re-enter the gasholder.
