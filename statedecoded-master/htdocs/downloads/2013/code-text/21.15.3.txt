OCCUPANT TO PAY TAX TO THE OPERATOR. (§ 21.15.3)

  OCCUPANT TO PAY TAX TO THE OPERATOR.	Unless prohibited by the laws of the
United States or the State of California or exempted by the provisions of this
article, every occupant occupying parking space in a parking facility shall be
required to pay the tax imposed herein to the operator along with the parking
fee for occupancy. If the parking fee is paid in installments, or if an amount
paid is less than the full amount of parking fee and tax accrued at the time of
payment, a proportionate share of the tax shall be deemed to have been paid with
each such payment or installment. Any unpaid tax shall be due upon the
occupant’s ceasing to occupy parking space in the parking facility. If for any
reason the tax is not paid to the operator, the Director of Finance shall
require that such tax shall be paid directly to the City. Payment of the tax to
the operator does not relieve the occupant of liability for the tax to the City
until the tax has been remitted to the City by the operator, unless the occupant
has a receipt for the parking fee and tax issued by the operator.
