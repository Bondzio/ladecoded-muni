	(Article and Section Added by Ord. No. 172,212, Eff. 10/23/98, Oper. 10/23/99.)

	Regulating tobacco product advertising on certain signs is a reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the general welfare of the children and minors of the City of Los Angeles exposed to certain signs advertising tobacco products.

	The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that children and minors deserve special solicitude because they lack the ability to assess and fully analyze the information presented through commercial advertising.

	Signs which can be seen from the outdoors are a unique and distinguishable medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation.

	The regulations promote the general welfare and temperance of children and minors and are intended to help reduce the illegal consumption and purchase of tobacco products by children and minors by limiting their exposure to the advertising of tobacco products on certain on-site and off-site signs.</full_text><order_by>20</order_by><text><unit id="2038" prefix=""><text>&#xA0; PURPOSE.
