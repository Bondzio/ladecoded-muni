EXCAVATIONS. (§ 91.7010)

  EXCAVATIONS.
	(Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)91.7010.1.
Height.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  No cut
slope shall exceed a vertical height of 100 feet (30 480 mm) unless horizontal
benches with a minimum width of 20 feet (6096 mm), as shown in Figure D are
installed at each 100 feet (30 480 mm) of vertical height.91.7010.2. Slope. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  No excavation
shall be made with a cut face steeper than one unit vertical in two units
horizontal (50% slope).	EXCEPTION:  The Department or the Board, in case an
appeal is made to it under Section 91.105, may permit the excavation to be made
with a cut face steeper in slope than one unit vertical in two units horizontal
(50% slope) if the applicant shows through investigation, subsurface
exploration, analysis and report by both a soils engineer and an engineering
geologist, to the Department’s satisfaction, that the underlying bedrock and
the materials to be exposed on the slope have strength characteristics
sufficient to produce a stable slope with a factor of safety of not less than
1.5 for static loads.	Existing or proposed slopes shall be regraded or cut so as
to be not steeper than the bedding planes in formation where the cut slope will
lie on the dip side of the strike line or the bedding planes shall be supported
by retaining walls or buttress fills designed pursuant to the provisions of CBC
Section 1819 or Section 91.7015 of this Code.	EXCEPTION:  Where special
conditions warrant, the Department may approve slopes steeper than the bedding
planes if the applicant shows through investigation, subsurface exploration,
analysis and report by both a soils engineer and an engineering geologist, to
the Department’s satisfaction, that the slopes will have a factor of safety
against sliding of not less than 1.5 for static loads.	Whenever grading at the
top of any natural or manufactured slope exposes soil or bedrock material that
will allow the infiltration of water in a manner that would adversely affect the
stability of the slope, the exposed area shall be capped with a relatively
impervious compacted soil blanket seal having a minimum thickness of two feet
(610 mm).  The soils engineer shall certify in writing that the blanket seal is
adequate to reduce water infiltration to permissible levels.91.7010.3.  Top of
Cut Slope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  The top of cut
slopes shall not be made nearer to a site boundary line than one fifth of the
vertical height of cut with a minimum of two feet (610 mm) and a maximum
horizontal distance of 10 feet (3048 mm).  The setback may need to be increased
for any required interceptor drains.  Setback dimensions shall be horizontal
distances measured perpendicular to the site boundary.  Setback dimensions
shall be as shown in Figure E.
