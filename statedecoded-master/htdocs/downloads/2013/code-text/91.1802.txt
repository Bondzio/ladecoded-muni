Ground-water Table.  A subsurface soil investigation shall be performed to
determine whether the historical high ground-water table is above or within five
feet (1524 mm) below the elevation of the lowest floor level where the lowest
floor level is located below the finished ground level adjacent to the
foundation.	EXCEPTION:  A subsurface soil investigation shall not be required

1807.91.1802.2.5.  Rock Strata.  Where subsurface explorations at the project
site indicate variations or doubtful characteristics in the structure of the
rock upon which foundations are to be constructed, a sufficient number of
borings shall be made to a depth of not less than ten feet (3048 mm) below the
level of the foundations and to a depth that would allow investigation of any
unsupported bedding planes or any other rock discontinuities that could
influence the foundation stability to provide assurance of the soundness of the
foundation bed and its load-bearing capacity.
