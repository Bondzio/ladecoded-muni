TANK COVERS. (§ 57.81.11)

  TANK COVERS.	Every dip tank shall be equipped with a tight-fitting
noncombustible type cover which will close automatically in case of fire.  Such
cover shall be capable of manual operation and shall be kept closed when not in
use.	EXCEPTIONS:	1.	Dip tanks not exceeding 10 gallons capacity may be equipped
with self-closing covers or manually operated covers.	2.	Automatic closing
operation of such covers may be waived when the nature of the process or the
presence of conveyors or the nature of the material in process makes the
installation or use of such heat-actuated automatic closing covers
impracticable, but such dip tanks shall be provided with substantial metal
covers by which such tanks may be closed when not in use and shall be provided
with an automatic fire extinguishing system.	3.	Aluminum, magnesium, or titanium
shall not be used for dip tank covers.
