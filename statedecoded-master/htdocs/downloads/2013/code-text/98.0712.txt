CONTINUOUS PUBLIC NUISANCES. (§ 98.0712)

  CONTINUOUS PUBLIC NUISANCES.
	(Added by Ord. No. 172,782, Eff. 9/30/99.)	Any Vacant Structure that was
originally secured by the Responsible Person’s voluntary actions or pursuant
to administrative or judicial order may be declared a permanent public nuisance
by the Superintendent if the structure subsequently becomes open and unsecured,
thereby requiring additional reinspection and resecuring of the structure by
either the Responsible Person or the Superintendent.  The Superintendent may
seek demolition of this continuous public nuisance by seeking a court order or
by following any of the administrative abatement procedures set forth in
Division 89 of Article 1 of Chapter IX of this Code.
