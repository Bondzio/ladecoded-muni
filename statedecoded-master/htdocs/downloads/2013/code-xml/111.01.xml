	Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, the words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows:

	(a)	&#x201C;Ambient Noise&#x201D; is the composite of noise from all sources near and far in a given environment, exclusive of occasional and transient intrusive noise sources and of the particular noise source or sources to be measured. Ambient noise shall be averaged over a period of at least 15 minutes at a location and time of day comparable to that during which the measurement is taken of the particular noise source being measured. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)

	(b)	&#x201C;Commercial Purpose&#x201D; is the use, operation, or maintenance of any sound amplifying equipment for the purpose of advertising any business, goods, or services, or for the purpose of attracting the attention of the public to, advertising for, or soliciting patronage or customers to or for any performance, show, entertainment, exhibition, or event, or for the purpose of demonstrating such sound equipment. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)

	(c)	&#x201C;Decibel&#x201D; (dB) is a unit of level which denotes the ratio between two (2) quantities which are proportional to power; the number of decibels corresponding to the ratio of two (2) amounts of power is ten (10) times the logarithm to the base (10) of this ratio. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)

(Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)

	(m)	&#x201C;Sound Truck&#x201D; is any motor vehicle, or any other vehicle regardless of motive power, whether in motion or stationary, which carries, is equipped with, or which has mounted thereon, or attached thereto, any sound amplifying equipment. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)
