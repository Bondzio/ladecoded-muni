Final Maps shall conform substantially to the approved Tentative Map. When a Final Map covers only a portion of the property shown on the Tentative Map, it shall be submitted to the Advisory Agency for its approval prior to submission to the City Engineer for checking. The Advisory Agency may refuse to approve the recording of any such map that does not by itself provide adequate or satisfactory access, design or improvements. The City Engineer may refuse to approve the recording of a Final Map covering only a portion of a Tentative Map, when in the process of checking the Final Map, he determines that it will not be feasible from an engineering standpoint to construct satisfactory improvements in the reduced area, unless additional street or easement dedications and improvements beyond the boundaries of the Final Map are provided.\n\n\t1.\tThe Final Map shall be accepted by the City Council provided;\n\n\t(a)\tThe necessary improvements as set forth in the approval of the Tentative Map have been installed and approved by the City, or provided the subdivider submits satisfactory improvement plans together with the necessary guarantee that the improvements will be installed.\n\n\t(b)\tThe required map checking fees have been paid by the subdivider.\n\n\t(c)\tAll checking has been completed by the various departments and public agencies.\n\n\t(d)\tTaxes, liens and special assessments have been paid, or such payment guaranteed.\n\n\t2.\tNo Final Map shall be recorded until the required improvements have been installed or agreed to be installed.\n\n\tC.\tFinal Map Requirements.

The precise position and character of each monument shall be shown on the Final Map. Where the elevation of the top of each such monument is not approximately level with the surface of the ground, its relative position shall be indicated.\n\n\tThe establishment of boundary monuments may be required by the Advisory Agency, the Appeal Board or the City Council upon appeal, prior to the recordation of the Final Map, however, such requirement may be modified to accept the submission of complete field notes as evidence of a thorough survey, or the setting of only a portion of the boundary monuments, or the referencing of monuments to adjacent reference points. The City Engineer shall submit a recommendation concerning this matter. Said reference points shall be indicated in a set of field notes showing clearly the ties between such monuments and sufficient number to set accurately each boundary monument after recordation of the Final Map.

The procedure and practice of all survey work, done on any subdivision, shall conform to the accepted standards of engineering and surveying professions. The Final Map shall close in all its parts.\n\n\tIn the event the City Engineer shall have established the center line of any street or alley in or adjoining a subdivision, the Final Map shall show such center line together with the reference to a field book or map showing such center line and the monuments which determine its position. If determined by ties, that fact shall be stated on the Final Map.\n\n\t2.\tNotes to be Furnished. For such center line monument set, the engineer or surveyor under whose supervision the survey has been made shall furnish to the City Engineer a set of notes showing clearly the ties such monument and a sufficient number (normally four) of durable distinctive reference points or monuments. Such reference points may be lead and tacks in sidewalks, or curbs, or two\u2013inch \u00d7 two\u2013inch stakes set back of the curb line and below the surface of the ground or such substitute thereof as appears to be not more likely to be disturbed.\n\n\tSuch set of notes shall be of such quality, form and completeness, and shall be on paper of such quality and size as may be necessary to conform to the standardized office records of the City Engineer.

The lots shall be numbered consecutively commencing with the number 1, except as otherwise provided herein, with no omissions or duplications. each numbered lot shall be shown entirely on one sheet.\n\n\tI.\tCurve Data. The length, radius and total central angle and bearings of terminal radii of each curve and the bearing of each radial line to each lot corner on each curve, and the central angle of each segment within each lot shall be shown on the Final Map.\n\n\tJ.\tEasements.\n\n\t1.\tLines. The Final Map shall show all the necessary data including width and side lines of all public easements to which the lots in the subdivision are subject.

(Added by Ord. No. 141,422, Eff. 2\/11\/71.) If the Advisory Agency has required dedication of the land for park and recreation sites as a condition of approval of a Tentative Map, the City Engineer shall not certify the Final Map to the City Council unless it includes such offer of dedication for said required land, provided, however, that said offer may be by separate instrument. If the Advisory Agency has required the payment of fees for the acquisition and development of park and recreation sites and facilities as a condition of approval of a Tentative Map, such fees shall be paid to the Department of Recreation and Parks to be deposited in appropriate trust accounts in the Recreation and Parks Fund. The Department of Recreation and Parks shall notify the City Engineer of receipt of such fees. The City Engineer may then certify the Final Map. If the Final Map is not recorded, then, upon the written request of the subdivider, the Department of Recreation and Parks shall process and approve the refund of such fees to the subdivider.","order_by":"07","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"8","name":"Division Of Land Regulations","identifier":"7","label":"article","url":"\/1\/7\/"},"2":{"id":"7","name":"General Provisions and
