	(Added by Ord. No. 169,347, Eff. 3/12/94.)

	Manufacturing and industrial businesses, including laundromats, where the estimated quantity of discharge for Sewerage Facilities Charge purposes is based upon the process used or number of machines and have an existing City of Los Angeles industrial flow Sewerage Facilities Charge credit may transfer all or part of this credit within or between a Revitalization, Enterprise or Empowerment Zone(s) or into a Revitalization, Enterprise or Empowerment Zone as defined in State or Federal law subject to the following conditions:

	(a)	A Sewerage Facilities Charge credit for the empty building shell(s) or most recent improvements if the land is vacant shall remain with the donor site.

	(b)	A Sewerage Facilities Charge must be paid or already exist for the building shell(s) at the receiver site.

	(c)	Local sewer availability and capacity at the receiver site to handle the transferred sewage flow must be verified by the City Engineer.&#xA0; An additional mainline sewer must be constructed at no cost to the City to a point of available capacity as determined by the City Engineer if local capacity does not exist.

	(d)	Only one transfer from a donor site to a receiver site shall be permitted and no transfer from a receive site back to a donor site shall be permitted.

	(e)	Any increase in sewer discharge at either the donor or receiver site over the adjusted sewer discharge flows established after the transfer at either site, shall require the payment of additional Sewerage Facilities Charge at the rate in effect at the time of the flow increase.

	(f)	A current Title Report must be submitted to the City Engineer verifying the ownership of the donor site from which flow credits are to be taken.

	(g)	If the person(s) requesting the transfer of flow credit is not the owner of the donor site, a notarized assignment of sewer discharge credits from the property owner to the person(s) requesting the transfer of the sewer discharge credits is required.&#xA0; This assignment can not be executed until it has been approved and signed by the City Engineer.&#xA0; Falsification of these documents will invalidate the transfer request and may result in referral to the City Attorney or District Attorney for prosecution.

	(h)	A non-refundable fee of $250 must be paid to initiate and document the transfer of Sewerage Facilities Charge flow credits.&#xA0; This fee shall be deposited directly into the Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund.&#xA0; The fee herein shall be adjusted, if required, in order to recover the City&#x2019;s administrative costs, and adopted in the same manner as provided in Section 12.37-I,1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code for establishing fees.

	(i)	The transfer of the sewer discharge must be initiated by submitting construction plans to the Department of Building and Safety for the receiver site within one year of approval of the transfer request.&#xA0; A written request to the City Engineer may be made for an additional one-year time extension.&#xA0; If the plans have not been submitted within two years, a new application for transfer of sewer discharge rights must be made.</full_text><order_by>16.2</order_by><ancestry><unit id="41" label="article"><name>Sewers, Water Courses And Drains</name><identifier>4</identifier><url>/6/4/</url></unit><unit id="5" label="chapter"><name>Public Works and Property</name><identifier>6</identifier><url>/6/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="1060"><structure_id>41</structure_id><section_number>64.03</section_number><catch_line>
