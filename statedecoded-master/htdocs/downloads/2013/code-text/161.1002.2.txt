APPEALS. (§ 161.1002.2)

.  APPEALS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 173,011, Eff. 1/30/00.)	Any person or entity aggrieved by a
General Manager’s decision pursuant to Division 8 of this article, other than
a referral to the City Attorney or issuance of an order to abate, may appeal by
filing a Notice of Appeal, on a form provided by the Department, which specifies
the alleged error of law or fact.  The Notice of Appeal shall be filed with the
Department no later than ten calendar days after service of the General
Manager’s decision, and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $150.00.  The
Notice of Appeal shall set forth the specific portions of the decision that are
appealed and the basis for the appeal.	If a timely Notice of Appeal is filed,
enforcement of those specific portions of the decision that are appealed shall
be suspended pending the appeal, except that a referral to the City Attorney or
an order referring or accepting the premises into the Urgent Repair Program
pursuant to Section 161.805(4) shall not be suspended.  If the Board denies the
appeal, the General Manager’s decision shall be reinstated and any orders
shall be effective retroactive to the dates specified in the original decision;
provided that the Appeals Board may limit the retroactivity of any fees imposed
if it finds that the party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the retroactive fees unjust.	If an appeal
is not filed within ten calendar days, the General Manager’s decision shall be
final.
