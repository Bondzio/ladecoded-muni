The Notice shall be served as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) calendar days of the seizure of the vehicle subject to forfeiture.\n\n\t(2)\tThe Notice of Intended Forfeiture shall be served by personal delivery, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the address on record with the Department of Motor Vehicles, or any other address a person entitled to receive

describe the person\u2019s interest in the vehicle.\u00a0 A copy of the Claim shall be served upon the City Attorney.\n\n\t(2)\tIf a verified Claim is filed in accordance with this section, the forfeiture proceeding shall be set for hearing within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the Claim is filed with the court.\n\n\t(3)\tThe City Attorney shall file a Petition for Forfeiture within ten (10) calendar days of being served with the Claim.\u00a0 The Petition for Forfeiture shall identify the vehicle to be forfeited, state the date and place of the seizure, describe the factual and legal basis for the forfeiture, and state the estimated value of the vehicle.\n\n\t(4)\tAll discovery shall be completed on or before the fifth calendar day before the hearing date, which date may be extended in the court\u2019s discretion.\n\n\t(5)\tThe hearing shall be before the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles.\u00a0 The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure shall apply to such proceedings unless otherwise inconsistent with the provisions or, procedures set forth in this section.\u00a0 A proceeding under this subsection is a summary proceeding and there shall be no joinder of actions, coordination of actions, or cross-complaints.\u00a0 The issues to be determined shall be limited strictly to those related to this section.\u00a0 Trial shall be by court or jury.\n\n\t(i)\tContested Forfeiture of Vehicle.\n\n\t(1)\tWhere forfeiture pursuant to this section is contested, the City Attorney shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in one or more of the circumstances described in subsection (b).\n\n\t(2)\tUpon proof that the vehicle was used in any of the circumstances described in subsection (b), the court shall:\n\n\t(A)\tDeclare the vehicle a nuisance; and\n\n\t(B)\tOrder that the vehicle be forfeited and sold, and that the proceeds from the sale be distributed in accordance with subsection (n); or\n\n\t(C)\tIf the vehicle was returned to the registered owner pursuant to subsection (f)(4), that it be seized, forfeited and sold, and that the proceeds from the sale be distributed in accordance with subsection (n).\n\n\t(j)\tReturn to Innocent Owner.\u00a0 Notwithstanding that a vehicle seized under this section may have been used in one or more of the circumstances described in subsection (b), the vehicle shall not be subject to forfeiture and shall be returned to the registered owner, upon payment of towing, storage and release charges, if the registered owner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that all of the following circumstances exist:\n\n\t(1)\tThe registered owner was not operating or present in or around the vehicle at the time of the violation resulting in its seizure; and\n\n\t(2)\tThe registered owner did not know that the vehicle was to be used in one or more of the circumstances described in subsection (b); and\n\n\t(3)\tThe registered owner was not negligent in allowing the vehicle to be used in one or more of the circumstances described in subsection (b).\n\n\t(k)\tDetention In Lieu of Forfeiture.\n\n\t(1)\tNotwithstanding that a vehicle seized under this section may have been used in one or more of the circumstances described in subsection (b), the court may, in lieu of forfeiture, order that the vehicle be detained for a period of not less than thirty (30) days and not more than one-hundred-twenty (120) days, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:\n\n\t(A)\tThe vehicle is the only vehicle available to members of the registered owner\u2019s household; and\n\n\t(B)\tForfeiture of the vehicle would cause significant hardship to a household member who relies upon the vehicle for transportation for legitimate purposes; and\n\n\t(C)\tIf released to the registered owner, the vehicle is unlikely to be used in further violation of this section in the future.\n\n\t(2)\tIf the court orders the vehicle detained pursuant to this subsection, the registered owner may reclaim the vehicle upon expiration of the detention period and payment of tow, storage and release charges.\n\n\t(l)\tStolen Vehicles.\u00a0 A vehicle that has been reported stolen prior to its seizure under this section shall not be subject to forfeiture under this section, unless the identity of the registered owner cannot be reasonably ascertained, or the registered owner fails to redeem the vehicle within sixty (60) days of the seizure.\u00a0 The registered owner of the vehicle may claim the vehicle, upon payment of tow, storage and release charges, provided the vehicle is not subject to any holds for traffic or parking violations and the vehicle registration is current.\n\n\t(m)\tUncontested Forfeiture of Vehicle.\n\n\t(1)\tWhere forfeiture pursuant to this section is not contested, the City Attorney shall have the authority to declare the vehicle forfeited under this section.\n\n\t(2)\tIf no Claims are timely filed, the City Attorney shall prepare a written Declaration of Forfeiture of the vehicle to the City.\u00a0 A written Declaration of Forfeiture signed by the City Attorney or his duly authorized designee shall be deemed to vest good and sufficient title to the forfeited vehicle in the City.\u00a0 The proceeds from the disposal of the vehicle declared forfeited by the City Attorney shall be distributed in accordance with subsection (n)(1).\u00a0 The City Attorney shall mail or otherwise provide a copy of the Declaration of Forfeiture to any person who received notice of the forfeiture proceedings pursuant to this section.\n\n\t(n)\tDisposal of Vehicle and Distribution of Proceeds.\n\n\t(1)\tIn any case in which a vehicle seized pursuant to this section is forfeited to the City, the vehicle shall be sold, unless a settlement is reached with the registered owner of the vehicle.\u00a0 All proceeds from the sale, or if cash is paid as settlement in lieu of forfeiture of the vehicle, shall be distributed and appropriated in the order of priority listed below:\n\n\t(A)\tTo pay costs associated with the towing, storage and release of the vehicle; and then\n\n\t(B)\tTo pay costs associated with the sale of the vehicle; and then\n\n\t(C)\tTo the legal owner of the vehicle, if any, up to the amount of the legal owner\u2019s interest in the vehicle; and then\n\n\t(D)\tTo the City\u2019s general fund.\n\n\t(2)\tIn a contested forfeiture proceeding pursuant to subsection (i), the court may make a different distribution of the proceeds in the interest of justice, including a distribution to a person or entity other than a registered or legal owner of the vehicle who can prove by clear and convincing evidence an interest in the vehicle, up to the amount of that person\u2019s provable interest, but only if such person or entity has provided the court with proof of his, her, or its claimed interest before the court makes a final disposition regarding the vehicle.\n\n\t(3)\tFor budgeting purposes, funds attributable to this ordinance shall not be considered anticipated revenue to the general fund.\n\n\t(o)\tRecovery of Monetary Loss.\u00a0 Nothing in this section shall preclude a vehicle owner or lienholder who suffers a monetary loss from the forfeiture of a vehicle under this section from recovering the amount of the actual monetary loss from the person or persons who committed the act giving rise to the forfeiture.","order_by":"71","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"66","name":"Disorderly Conduct\nPlaces And
