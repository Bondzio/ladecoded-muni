exclusively of dwelling units in all or parts of the District.\n\n\t4.\tIf the City Council finds that further restricting the uses in a Mixed Use District is appropriate in light of the proposed district\u2019s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan, then the Council may do so in the ordinance establishing the district.\n\n\tD.\tYards.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article to the contrary, the following yards shall apply to Mixed Use Projects:\n\n\t1.\tThe yards of the

other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the following development incentives shall apply in Mixed Use Districts:\n\n\t1.\tHousing.\u00a0 The individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District shall establish an incentive for dwelling units in Mixed Use Projects.\u00a0 The amount of the incentive shall be based on an appropriate consideration of the proposed district\u2019s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan.\n\n\tThe incentive shall be shown on the \u201cZoning Map\u201d by use of the capital letters \u201cMU\u201d for Mixed Use Projects and \u201cC\u201d for Commercial Uses, preceded by the applicable numerical limits.\u00a0 The first two-digit number before the diagonal line shall indicate the maximum height permitted.\u00a0 The first number after the diagonal line, which may include a decimal fraction, shall indicate the maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR).\u00a0 For example, a Mixed Use District zoned C2 45\/2.0-MU 35\/1.5-C means that a Mixed Use Project may not exceed a maximum height of 45 feet for the entire Project or an FAR of 2.0.\u00a0 The Commercial Uses in a Mixed Use Project would be restricted to a maximum FAR of 1.5.\u00a0 Projects comprised exclusively of Commercial Uses would be restricted to a maximum height of 35 feet and a maximum FAR of 1.5.\u00a0 If the letter \u201cU\u201d appears before the diagonal line instead of a number, then an unlimited height is permitted.\n\n\t(a)\tIf a height or FAR housing incentive would result in a maximum height or FAR which exceeds that of the underlying base zone, then the Project may not proceed until the height district of the base zone is changed.\n\n\t(b)\tThe minimum dwelling unit FAR for Mixed Use Projects with a total FAR of 6.0 or greater is 1.5\n\n\t(c)\tThe lot area requirements of the R5 zone shall apply to Mixed Use Projects with a total FAR of 6.0 or greater.\n\n\t2.\tPedestrian Amenities.\u00a0 Pedestrian Amenities shall not be included in the calculation of permitted FAR.\n\n\t3.\tParking.\u00a0 If a proposed Mixed Use District includes lots within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major Bus Center, or lots within 750 feet of a Central Parking Structure, then the individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District shall include a parking incentive which specifies a reduction in the number of parking spaces required by Section 12.21A4.\u00a0 Provided, however, a minimum of two spaces for every 1,000 square feet of non-residential floor area shall be required.\u00a0 In determining the appropriate level of parking reduction, the City Council shall consider such factors as local transit dependency and automobile usage, traffic, available parking, and level of transit service, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan.\n\n\t(a)\tTransit Facilities.\u00a0 The transit facility incentive shall be restricted to dwelling units and Commercial Uses in Mixed Use Projects within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major Bus Center.\n\n\t(b)\tCentral Parking Structures.\u00a0 The Central Parking Structure incentive shall be restricted to Commercial Uses within 750 feet of a Central Parking Structure.\u00a0 To make use of this incentive, the owner(s) of the Central Parking Structure must execute and record in the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s Office, a covenant and agreement for the benefit of the City of Los Angeles which provides that the required parking shall be maintained in perpetuity or until the Director of Planning determines that it is no longer necessary.\u00a0 This incentive may not be combined with the transit facility incentive set forth in (a) above.\n\n\t(c)\tMeasurement of Distance.\u00a0 Distance from a transit facility or Central Parking Structure shall be measured as specified in Section 12.21A4(g).\n\n\t(d)\tDowntown Exceptions.\u00a0 The parking incentive for dwelling units as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) above shall not be authorized in the Parking Exception Area for the Central City as described in Section 12.21A4(p).\u00a0 The parking incentive for Commercial Uses as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) and (b) above shall not be authorized in the Downtown Business District Exception Area as described in Section 12.21A4(I).\n\n\t(e)\tAffordable Housing.\u00a0 The transit facility and Central Parking Structure incentives set forth above shall not be combined with the parking reduction provided for affordable housing as set forth in Section 12.22A25(d)(2).\n\n\t4.\tFacade Treatments, Corner Lots, and Community Facilities.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10\/10\/00.)\u00a0 Each Mixed Use Project shall be entitled to one of the following incentives by right.\u00a0 To obtain an entitlement for two or more of these incentives, the approval of the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 12.24W28 is required.\n\n\t(a)\tFacade Treatments.\u00a0 Unless eliminated or modified by the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District, if the maximum height otherwise permitted by the underlying zone or established pursuant to Section 13.09E1 above is less than 100 feet, then a Mixed Use Project is entitled to an increase in height of no more than ten feet, provided that the additional height is used for a Facade Treatment.\n\n\tThe individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District may not modify the following restrictions:\n\n\t(1)\tThe Facade Treatment incentive may not be utilized on lots adjacent to or abutting an RW1 or more restrictive zone as defined by Sections 12.04 or 12.23;\n\n\t(2)\tThe Facade Treatment incentive may not be combined with the Corner Lot incentive described in Paragraph (b) below; and\n\n\t(3)\tThe Facade Treatment incentive may not be used for signs or to increase the floor area of a structure.\n\n\t(b)\tCorner Lots.\u00a0 Unless eliminated or modified by the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District, a Mixed Use Project on a Corner Lot is entitled to an increase in height, FAR, and residential density for dwelling units that is 20 percent greater than what is otherwise permitted by the underlying zone or what is established pursuant to Section 13.09E1 above.\n\n\tThe individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District may not modify the following restrictions:\n\t(1)\tUnless a conditional use permit pursuant to Section 12.24 W 28 is also obtained, a Mixed Use Project which secures an affordable housing density bonus pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915 shall not also be entitled to the Corner Lot incentive; and\n\n\t(2)\tThe Corner Lot incentive may not be utilized on lots adjacent to or abutting an RW1 Zone or a more restrictive zone as defined by Sections 12.04 or 12.23.\n\n\t(c)\tCommunity Facilities.\u00a0 Unless modified by the individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District, no more than 75 percent of the total floor area of a child or adult day care facility, community meeting room, cultural center, museum or telecommuting center shall be included in the calculation of permitted FAR.\n\n\t5.\tMini-Shopping Centers and Commercial Corner Developments.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.
