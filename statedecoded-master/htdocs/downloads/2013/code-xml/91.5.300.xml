&#x201C;moderate&#x201D; or &#x201C;severe&#x201D;) for concrete as determined from the Weathering
Probability Map [Figure R301.2(3)].&#xA0; The grade of masonry units shall be

for protection depending on whether there has been a history of local
subterranean termite damage.
d.	The jurisdiction shall fill in this part of the table with the wind speed
from the basic wind speed map [FigureR301.2(4)]. Wind exposure category shall be

the jurisdiction&#x2019;s entry into the National Flood Insurance Program (date of
adoption of the first code or ordinance for management of flood hazard areas),
(b) the date(s) of the Flood Insurance Study and (c) the panel numbers and dates
of all currently effective FIRMs and FBFMs or other flood hazard map adopted by
the authority having jurisdiction, as amended.
h.	In accordance with Sections R905.2.7.1, R905.4.3.1, R905.5.3.1, R905.6.3.1,
R905.7.3.1 and R905.8.3.1, where there has been a history of local damage from
the effects of ice damming, the jurisdiction shall fill in this part of the
table with &#x201C;YES&#x201D;.&#xA0; Otherwise, the jurisdiction shall fill in this part of
the table with &#x201C;NO&#x201D;.
i.	The jurisdiction shall fill in this part of the table with the 100-year
return period air freezing index (BF-days) from Figure R403.3(2) or from the
100-year (99%) value on the National Climatic Data Center data table &#x201C;Air
Freezing Index &#x2013; USA Method (Base 32&#xB0;)&#x201D; at www.ncdc.noaa.gov/fpsf.html.
j.	The jurisdiction shall fill in this part of the table with the mean annual
temperature from the National Climatic Data Center data table &#x201C;Air Freezing
Index &#x2013; USA Method (Base 32&#xB0;F)&#x201D; at www.ncdc.noaa.gov/fpsf.html.
k.	In accordance with Section R301.2.1.5, where there is local historical data
documenting structural damage to buildings due to topographic wind speed-up
effects, the jurisdiction shall fill in this part of the table with &#x201C;YES&#x201D;.&#xA0;
Otherwise, the jurisdiction shall indicate &#x201C;NO&#x201D; in this part of the table.

91.5.301.2.2.2.5. Irregular Buildings.&#xA0; Prescriptive construction as regulated
by this code shall not be used for irregular structures located in Seismic
Design Categories C, D0, D1, and D2.&#xA0; Irregular portions of structures shall be
designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice to the extent the
irregular features affect the performance of the remaining structural system.&#xA0;
When the forces associated with the irregularity are resisted by a structural
system designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice, design of the
remainder of the building shall be permitted using the provisions of this
code.&#xA0; A building or portion of a building shall be considered to be irregular
when one or more of the following conditions occur:

	1.	When exterior shear wall lines or braced wall panels are not in one plane
vertically from the foundation to the uppermost story in which they are
required;

	2.	When a section of floor or roof is not laterally supported by shear walls or
braced wall lines on all edges;

	Exception:&#xA0; Portions of floors that do not support shear walls or braced wall
panels above, or roofs, shall be permitted to extend no more than 6 feet (1829
mm) beyond a shear wall or braced wall line.

	3.	When the end of a braced wall panel occurs over an opening in the wall
below;

	4.	When an opening in a floor or roof exceeds the lesser of 12 feet (3658 mm)
or 50 percent of the least floor or roof dimension;

	5.	When portions of a floor level are vertically offset;

	6.	When shear walls and braced wall lines do not occur in two perpendicular
directions;

	7.	When stories above-grade partially or completely braced by wood wall framing
in accordance with CBC Section R602 or steel wall framing in accordance with CBC
Section R603 include masonry or concrete construction;

	Exception:&#xA0; Fireplaces, chimneys and masonry veneer as permitted by this
code.&#xA0; When this irregularity applies, the entire story shall be designed in
accordance with accepted engineering practice.

91.5.301.2.2.3.5.1. AISI S230, Section B1.&#xA0; AISI S230, Section B1 is modified
to read as follows:&#xA0;

	Where No. 8 screws are specified, the required number of screws in a
steel-to-steel connection shall be permitted to be reduced in accordance with
the reduction factors in Table B1-1, when larger screws are used or when sheets
of steel are being connected and are thicker than 33 mils (0.84 mm).&#xA0; When
applying the reduction factor, the resulting number of screws shall be rounded
up.

91.5.311.2. Egress Door.&#xA0; At least one egress door shall be provided for each
dwelling unit.&#xA0; The egress door shall be side-hinged, and shall provide a
minimum clear width of 32 inches (813 mm) when measured between the face of the
door and the stop, with the door open 90 degrees (1.57 rad).&#xA0; The minimum clear
height of the door opening shall not be less than 78 inches (1981 mm) in height
measured from the top of the threshold to the bottom of the stop.&#xA0; This is
accomplished by providing a door not less than 3 feet in width and 6 feet 8
inches in height.&#xA0; Egress doors shall be readily openable from inside the
dwelling without the use of a key or special knowledge or effort.&#xA0; Every
interior door in a doorway through which occupants pass shall have a minimum
width of 32 inches (813 mm).

91.5.322.1.4.1. Determination of Design Flood Elevations.&#xA0; If design flood
elevations are not specified, the building official is authorized to require the
applicant to:

	1.	Obtain and reasonably use data available from a federal, state or other
source; or

	2.	Determine the design flood elevation in accordance with accepted hydrologic
and hydraulic engineering practices used to define special flood hazard areas.&#xA0;
Determinations shall be undertaken by a registered civil engineer who shall
document that the technical methods used reflect currently accepted engineering
practice.&#xA0; Studies, analyses and computations shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow thorough review and approval.
