No. 181,624, Eff. 5\/9\/11.)\n\n\tA.\tPurpose.\u00a0 This Section sets forth procedures and guidelines for the establishment of \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay Districts in single-family residential neighborhoods in designated Hillside Areas, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Chapter, throughout the City.\u00a0 The purpose of the \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay District is to permit Residential Floor Area, height, and Grading limits in the R1, RS, RE, and RA zones to be higher or lower than normally permitted by this Code in areas where the proposed overlay will further enhance the existing scale of homes and\/or help to preserve the existing character of the neighborhood as effectively as the limitations or requirements otherwise established in this Code; and where these changes will be consistent with the policies and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan.\n\n\tB.\tEstablishment of the District.\u00a0 The procedures set forth in Section 12.32 S. of this Code shall be followed, however, each \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay District shall include only properties in the RA, RE, RS, or R1 zones.\u00a0 The overlay shall not generally be less than 100 acres in area; however, the 100 acres do not need to be within one contiguous boundary as long as no one subarea is less than 25 acres in area, and the entire 100 acres is located within an overall area of 200 contiguous acres.\u00a0 The precise boundary of a district may be adjusted for urban features such as topography, freeways or Streets\/Highways.\u00a0 Boundaries shall be along Street Frontages and shall not split parcels.\u00a0 An \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay District may encompass an area, which is designated, in whole or in part, as a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone and\/or Specific Plan.\u00a0 The \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay District shall include contiguous parcels, which may only be separated by public Streets, ways or alleys or other physical features, or as set forth in the rules approved by the Director of Planning.\u00a0 Precise boundaries are required at the time of application for, or initiation of, an individual overlay.\n\n\tC.\tDevelopment Regulations.\u00a0 The Department of Building and Safety shall not issue a Building permit for a residential Structure within an \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay District unless the residential Structure conforms to the regulations set forth in a specific \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay District.\u00a0 The development regulations for each \u201cHS\u201d Hillside Standards Overlay District shall be limited to changes in the numerical values of the Residential Floor Area, height, and Grading limits in the R1, RS, RE, and RA zones stated in this Chapter (Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 \u2013 Paragraphs (a) Residential Floor Area, (d) Height Limits, and (f) Grading) and shall not result in a substantial deviation in approach, method of calculation, or measurement from the corresponding language already in place in this Chapter 1.\u00a0 The development regulations shall be determined at the time the overlay is established.\u00a0 The development regulations shall serve to enhance the existing or envisioned character of the overlay.","order_by":"16","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"43","name":"Specific Plan \u2013
