(\u00a7 12.00)\n\n\u00a0 TITLE.\n\n\tThis article shall be known as the \u201cComprehensive Zoning Plan of the City of\nLos Angeles.\u201d\n\n\tIt is well settled that a municipality may divide land into districts and\nprescribe regulations governing the uses permitted therein, and that zoning\nordinances when reasonable in object and not arbitrary in operation constitute a\njustifiable exercise of police power, and as intendment is in favor of the\nvalidity of such ordinances the court will not substitute its judgment for that\nof the zoning action.\n\tLockard v. The City of Los Angeles, 33 Cal. 2d 453.\n\tClemens v. The City of Los Angeles, 36 Cal.2d 95.\n\tWheeler v. Gregg, 90 Cal. App. 2d 348.\n\tBurke v. City of Los Angeles, 68 Cal. App.2d 189.\n\tEx Parte Quong Wo, 161 Cal 222.\n\tMiller v. Board of Public Works, 95 Cal. 485.\n\tZahn v. Board of Public Works, 195 Cal. 497.\n\tPeople v. Norton, 108 Cal. App. Supp. 767.\n\tOtis v. City of Los Angeles. 52 Cal. App. 2d 605.\n\tHadacheck v. Alexander. 169 Cal. 616.\n\tBrown v. City of Los Angeles. 183 Cal. 783, 789.\n\tEx Parte Hadacheck.165 Cal. 416.\n\tMarblehead Land Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 47 Fed. 2d 528.\n\tKort v. City of Los Angeles, 52 Cal. App. 2d 804.\n\tAcker v. Baldwin, 18 Cal 2d 341.\n\tIn re Ruppe, 80 Cal. App. 629.\n\tVillage of Euclid v. Amber Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 71 L. Ed. 303.\n\tWilkins v. City of San Bernardino, 29 Cal 2d 332.\n\n\tThe right to use private property may be restricted by an ordinance which\nfollows a reasonable plan even though the use is neither a nuisance per se, nor\na menace to health, safety or morals in the district from which it is excluded.\nA retroactive ordinance which causes substantial injury to a business which is\nnot a nuisance would be unreasonable and unjustifiable.\n\tPeople v. Nixon, CR A 2201.\n\n\tComprehensive Zoning is a legitimate exercise of the police power and city\nordinances prohibiting the production of oil in designated zones are valid if\nreasonable and not arbitrary.\n\tBeverly Oil Company v. City of Los Angeles, 40 Cal. 2nd 552.\n\n\tAny zoning regulation is a valid exercise of the police power which is\nnecessary to subserve the ends for which the police power exists, namely, the\npromotion of the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The police\npower as evidence in zoning ordinances has a much wider scope than the mere\noppression of offensive users of property. Such regulations do not constitute a\ntaking of property for which compensations must be made.\n\tMiller v. Board of Public Works. 195 Cal. 482.\n\n\tIt is not a ground of invalidity of a zoning ordinance that a business is\nlawful, innocent, inoffensive and dignified, for if restrictions on business\ncould be invalidated on that ground there could be no such thing as\ncomprehensive city planning.\n\tKort v. City of Los Angeles, 52 Cal. App. 2nd, 804, 809.\n\n\tA master plan or some over-all plan contemplated by a city in the development\nand building up of a subdivision need not be approved and adopted before\nauthority vests in relation to conditions imposed by the city on a subdivider,\nwhere a Charter contemplates that portion of the plan may be adopted.\n\tAyers v. City of Los Angeles, 34 Cal. 2d 31.\n"}
