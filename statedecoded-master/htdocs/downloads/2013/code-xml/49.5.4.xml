	A.	No officer or employee of the City shall use or threaten to use any official authority or influence to discourage, restrain or interfere with any other person for the purpose of preventing such person from acting in good faith to report or otherwise bring to the attention of the City Ethics Commission or other appropriate agency, office or department any information which, if true, would constitute: a work-related violation by a City officer or employee of any law or regulation, gross waste of City funds, gross abuse of authority, a specified and substantial danger to public health or safety due to an act or omission of a City official or employee, use of a City office or position or of City resources for personal gain, or a conflict of interest of a City officer or employee.

	B.	No officer or employee of the City shall use or threaten to use any official authority or influence to effect any action as a reprisal against a City officer or employee who reports or otherwise brings to the attention of the Commission or other appropriate agency, office or department any information regarding the subjects described in Subsection A.
