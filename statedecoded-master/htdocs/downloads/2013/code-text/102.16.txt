DEFAULTS AND UNCONTESTED CASES. (§ 102.16)

  DEFAULTS AND UNCONTESTED CASES.	If the respondent fails to file a notice of
defense or fails to appear at the hearing, the Board may take action based upon
the respondent’s express admissions or upon other evidence, and affidavits may
be used as evidence without any notice to respondent; and where the burden of
proof is on the respondent to establish that he is entitled to the Board action
sought, the Board may act without taking evidence. Nothing herein shall be
construed to deprive the respondent of the right to make any showing by way of
mitigation.  (Amended by Ord. No. 158,410, Eff. 11/27/83.)
