determined that the vacant portion is significant.<br \/><br \/>\t4.\tParcels with superseded use codes 010A and 010B that are still remaining on the Los Angeles County Assessors records are assigned use codes of 010F and 010H, respectively.<br \/><br \/>\t5.\tParcels with unrecognizable use codes are assigned a use code of 9800 or 9900 and are assessed in the same manner as use code 0100

Los Angeles County Department of Public Works records for Flood Control Benefit Assessment.\t2.\tA vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the total area of those parcels whose improvement value is $4,000 or less (except parcels with use codes 2700 and 3800 and for 800 series parcel numbers).\t3.\tA vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the vacant portion of parcels whose improvement value is more than $4,000 if it is determined that the vacant portion is significant.\t4.\tParcels with superseded use codes 010A and 010B that are still remaining on the Los Angeles County Assessors records are assigned use codes of 010F and 010H, respectively.\t5.\tParcels with unrecognizable use codes are assigned a use code of 9800 or 9900 and are assessed in the same manner as use code 0100 parcels.\t6.\tParcels with unknown areas are assigned an area of 0.1526 acre (the median single-family residential parcel size).\t7.\tGovernment owned parcels, denoted with 270 through 300 and 900 series parcel numbers by the Assessor, are not assessed.\t8.\tThe areas of common area parcels of cluster-type developments are divided equally among the development owners.","type":"section","prefixes":[""],"prefix":"","entire_prefix":"","prefix_anchor":"","level":1}}}
