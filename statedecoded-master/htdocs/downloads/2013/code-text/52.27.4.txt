  PRESENTATION OF BADGE AND OTHER CITY-ISSUED EQUIPMENT AS A MEMORIAL TO A
REGULAR POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 170,055, Eff. 11/13/94; Renumbered from Former Sec.
52.27.2 by Ord. No. 177,374, Eff. 4/9/06.)	(a)	Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Code, the Board of Police Commissioners may:	1.	Cause the
officer’s badge and number to be retired from active service and use.	2.	Cause
the badge, or a similar badge, to be presented to the deceased officer’s
surviving spouse of surviving member(s) of the officer’s immediate family, as
a memorial honoring the officer.	3.	Cause the officer’s City-issued equipment,
including an officer’s duty weapon, shooting medals, cap piece, handcuffs,
call box key and buttons, to also be included at the City’s expense in the
memorial which is presented to the deceased officer’s surviving spouse or
surviving member(s) of the officer’s immediate family.	A.	Prior to the
presentation, the Board shall cause the badge and other City-issued equipment to
be affixed permanently to a plaque or within a frame, which will effectively
preclude improper use of the badge or other City-issued equipment, with a
statement clearly visible showing the officer’s death in the line of
duty.	B.	No person shall remove from the plaque or frame any badge or other
City-issued equipment presented under this section, or wear such a badge, or
display it, except while it is attached to the plaque or within the frame, with
the above described statement clearly visible.  Any badge or other City-issued
equipment removed, worn or displayed in violation of this subsection shall be
subject to confiscation by the Board.
