	NOTES:

	1.	Parcel identification numbers and corresponding use codes are taken from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works records for Flood Control Benefit Assessment.

	2.	A vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the total area of those parcels whose improvement value is $4,000 or less (except parcels with use codes 2700 and 3800 and for 800 series parcel numbers).

	3.	A vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the vacant portion of parcels whose improvement value is more than $4,000 if it is determined that the vacant portion is significant.

	4.	Parcels with superseded use codes 010A and 010B that are still remaining on the Los Angeles County Assessors records are assigned use codes of 010F and 010H, respectively.

	5.	Parcels with unrecognizable use codes are assigned a use code of 9800 or 9900 and are assessed in the same manner as use code 0100 parcels.

	6.	Parcels with unknown areas are assigned an area of 0.1526 acre (the median single-family residential parcel size).

	7.	Government owned parcels, denoted with 270 through 300 and 900 series parcel numbers by the Assessor, are not assessed.

	8.	The areas of common area parcels of cluster-type developments are divided equally among the development owners.</full_text><order_by>51.05</order_by><ancestry><unit id="104" label="article"><name>Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charge</name><identifier>4.2</identifier><url>/6/4.2/</url></unit><unit id="5" label="chapter"><name>Public Works and Property</name><identifier>6</identifier><url>/6/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="731"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.01</section_number><catch_line>Definitions.</catch_line><url>/64.51.01/</url><token>64.51.01</token></unit><unit id="3295"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.03</section_number><catch_line>Charges.</catch_line><url>/64.51.03/</url><token>64.51.03</token></unit><unit id="1923"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.05</section_number><catch_line>Land Use Categories And Run-Off Factors.</catch_line><url>/64.51.05/</url><token>64.51.05</token></unit><unit id="1785"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.07</section_number><catch_line>Collection And Enforcement.</catch_line><url>/64.51.07/</url><token>64.51.07</token></unit><unit id="964"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.09</section_number><catch_line>Adjustments, Exemptions And Appeals.</catch_line><url>/64.51.09/</url><token>64.51.09</token></unit><unit id="583"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.11</section_number><catch_line>Stormwater Pollution Abatement Fund.</catch_line><url>/64.51.11/</url><token>64.51.11</token></unit><unit id="1293"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.13</section_number><catch_line>Disposition Of Funds.</catch_line><url>/64.51.13/</url><token>64.51.13</token></unit><unit id="1707"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.15</section_number><catch_line>Annual Review.</catch_line><url>/64.51.15/</url><token>64.51.15</token></unit><unit id="855"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.17</section_number><catch_line>Severability.</catch_line><url>/64.51.17/</url><token>64.51.17</token></unit></structure_contents><next_section id="1785"><structure_id>104</structure_id><section_number>64.51.07</section_number><catch_line>Collection And Enforcement.</catch_line><url>/64.51.07/</url><token>64.51.07</token></next_section><metadata></metadata><references></references><url>/64.51.05/</url><token>64.51.05</token><formats><txt>/64.51.05.txt</txt><json>/64.51.05.xml</json></formats><dublin_core><Title>Land Use Categories And Run-Off Factors.</Title><Type>Text</Type><Format>text/html</Format><Identifier>&#xA7; 64.51.05</Identifier><Relation>Los Angeles Municipal Code</Relation></dublin_core><plain_text>                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

	NOTES:	1.	Parcel identification numbers and corresponding use codes are taken
from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works records for Flood Control
Benefit Assessment.	2.	A vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off
factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the total area of those parcels whose
improvement value is $4,000 or less (except parcels with use codes 2700 and 3800
and for 800 series parcel numbers).	3.	A vacant designation (V) with a
corresponding run-off factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the vacant portion of
parcels whose improvement value is more than $4,000 if it is determined that the
vacant portion is significant.	4.	Parcels with superseded use codes 010A and
010B that are still remaining on the Los Angeles County Assessors records are
assigned use codes of 010F and 010H, respectively.	5.	Parcels with
unrecognizable use codes are assigned a use code of 9800 or 9900 and are
assessed in the same manner as use code 0100 parcels.	6.	Parcels with unknown
areas are assigned an area of 0.1526 acre (the median single-family residential
parcel size).	7.	Government owned parcels, denoted with 270 through 300 and 900
series parcel numbers by the Assessor, are not assessed.	8.	The areas of common
area parcels of cluster-type developments are divided equally among the
development owners.

	NOTES:	1.	Parcel identification numbers and corresponding use codes are taken from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works records for Flood Control Benefit Assessment.	2.	A vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the total area of those parcels whose improvement value is $4,000 or less (except parcels with use codes 2700 and 3800 and for 800 series parcel numbers).	3.	A vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of 0.0190 is assigned to the vacant portion of parcels whose improvement value is more than $4,000 if it is determined that the vacant portion is significant.	4.	Parcels with superseded use codes 010A and 010B that are still remaining on the Los Angeles County Assessors records are assigned use codes of 010F and 010H, respectively.	5.	Parcels with unrecognizable use codes are assigned a use code of 9800 or 9900 and are assessed in the same manner as use code 0100 parcels.	6.	Parcels with unknown areas are assigned an area of 0.1526 acre (the median single-family residential parcel size).	7.	Government owned parcels, denoted with 270 through 300 and 900 series parcel numbers by the Assessor, are not assessed.	8.	The areas of common area parcels of cluster-type developments are divided equally among the development owners.</text><type>section</type><prefixes><unit></unit></prefixes><entire_prefix></entire_prefix><prefix_anchor></prefix_anchor><level>1</level></unit></text></law>
