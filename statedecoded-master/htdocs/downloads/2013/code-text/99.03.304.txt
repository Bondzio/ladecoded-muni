TIERS. (§ 99.03.304)

99.03.304.1.1.    The provisions of Appendices A4 and A5 outline the means of
achieving enhanced construction levels by incorporating additional green
building measures.  Buildings complying with tiers specified for each occupancy
contain additional prerequisite and elective green building measures necessary
to meet the threshold of each tier.	Where there are practical difficulties
involved in complying with the threshold levels of a tier, the Department may
grant modifications for individual cases.  The Department shall first find that
a special individual reason makes the strict letter of the tier impractical and
that modification is in conformance with the intent and purpose of the
measure.  The details of any action granting modification shall be recorded and
entered in the files of the Department.
