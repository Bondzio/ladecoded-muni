No. 121,900, Eff. 6\/4\/62.)\n\n\t(a)\tExcavation Permit Fees.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9\/28\/12.)\n\n\t1.\tFixed Fee Permits.\u00a0 For an excavation of 1,000 square feet of area or less, except for fees subject to the provisions of Subdivision 2. of this Subsection, the Bureau of Engineering shall charge and collect the following permit and inspection fees:\n\n\t(aa)\tExcavation Utility (U) Permit.\u00a0 Excavation utility (U) permits are issued to public utilities regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California, and except for permits subject to the provisions of Subdivision 2. of this Subsection, the fee to process an excavation (U) permit is $185.\u00a0 The fee to inspect each U permit of an excavation area of 99 square feet or less is $114, and the fee to inspect an area of more than 99 square feet but less than 1,000 square feet is $2.20 per square foot.\n\n\t(bb)\tExcavation (E) Permit.\u00a0 Except for permits subject to the provisions of Subdivision 2. of this Subsection, the fee to process an excavation (E) permit is $425.\u00a0 The fee to inspect each E permit of an excavation area of 99 square feet or less is $114, and the fee to inspect an area of more than 99 square feet but less than 1,000 square feet is $2.20 per square foot.\n\n\t(cc)\tSpecial Inspection Charges.\u00a0 In addition to the fees identified in Paragraphs (aa) and (bb) of this Subdivision, the Bureau of Engineering may, when the Bureau of Engineering or the Bureau of Contract Administration determines that additional inspections beyond those ordinarily required in overseeing work permitted by an excavation utility (U) permit or excavation (E) permit are required, charge a fee for additional inspections.\u00a0 The fee for conducting additional inspections pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph is $95 per hour, except that there will be a minimum four hour charge of $380 for inspections on weekends or on any day determined to be a holiday pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.119 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code.\n\n\tThe charges authorized by this Paragraph shall apply to all fixed fees imposed or collected by the Bureau of Engineering for the issuance or administration of any permit authorized by this Code where the Bureau of Engineering or the Bureau of Contract Administration requires inspections in addition to those paid for by the underlying fee.\n\n\t2.\tActual Cost Permits.\u00a0 The fee to process a (U) or (E) excavation permit for an excavation of more than 1,000 square feet in area, or to process a (U) or (E) excavation permit for an excavation of 1,000 square feet or less in area where the Bureau of Engineering determines that due to the complexity of the permitted work it would cost more to issue and administer a permit than would be collected pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 1. of this Subsection, is the actual cost of services provided by the City for issuance and oversight of the permit and the permitted project, except for costs that may be incurred by a Proprietary Department subject to the provisions of Article VI of the City Charter, and except for the Street Damage Restoration Fee and the Slurry Seal Damage Restoration Fee.\u00a0 The actual cost determination shall include, but not be limited to, all direct and indirect labor costs, retirement and overhead costs, costs for plan checking and engineering services, project inspection costs, and the costs of testing materials.\u00a0 Before the Bureau of Engineering may issue a permit subject to the provisions of this Subdivision, the applicant must deposit with the Bureau an amount that the Bureau estimates will be the actual costs owed pursuant to the provisions of this Subdivision.\n\n\tFor permits and projects that are subject to the provisions of this Subdivision, if before completion of the permitted project the Bureau of Engineering determines that additional funds are needed to compensate the City for the actual cost of issuance and oversight of the permit and permitted project, the City may halt all work on the project for which the application was made and require the applicant to pay the amount that the Bureau estimates will be needed to compensate the City for the actual cost of providing its services.\u00a0 At the conclusion of providing the requested services, if actual costs to the City are less than the amount deposited, the applicant shall be refunded the difference.\u00a0 The City shall not approve any permitted project until all monies owed pursuant to the provisions of this Subdivision are paid.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Subdivision, the City reserves the right to impose additional fees and charges for services provided or costs incurred that were not included in the basis of the determination of the actual cost of City services.\n\n\t3.\tTie-Back Fees.\u00a0 In addition to the fees imposed pursuant to the provisions of Subdivisions 1. and 2. of this Subsection, the following fees shall apply to excavations requiring shoring that contain tie-backs:\n\n\t(aa) \tFor each tie-back installed in a public right-of-way, a fee of $605.\n\n\t(bb)\tFor each de-tensioned anchor rod left in place less than 20 feet below the street surface within a public right-of-way, a fee of $2,040.\n\n\t4.\tResurfacing Charges.\u00a0 When an excavation subject to the provisions of Paragraph (bb) of Subdivision 1. of this Subsection requires the resurfacing of public streets or alleys, or replacing sidewalks, curbs or gutters, the Bureau of Engineering shall charge and collect applicable fees identified in Subsection (b) of Section 62.109.\n\n\t(b)\tResurfacing Charges.\n\n\t1.\tSchedule of Fees.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 157,341, Eff. 2\/13\/83.)\n\n\taa.\tThe Board, with concurrence of the Director of the Office of Administrative and Research Services (Amended by Ord. No. 173,363, Eff. 7\/29\/00, Oper. 7\/1\/00.) shall determine on a regular basis, the verifiable costs of the City for services provided by the City whenever the improved surface of an excavated or damaged street is replaced by the Board, or the restoration of an unimproved surface of a street is subject to inspection by the Board. Those costs shall be used by the Board to develop, and at any time during each fiscal year but not later than April 1 the Board shall adopt a cost recovery schedule of applicable charges necessary to recover City costs of inspection and other services performed with respect to a specific type of work or improvement.\n\n\tFor the purposes of this section, the word \u201cexcavation,\u201d or any derivation thereof, shall mean each single continuous broken surface area of a street, sidewalk, driveway, curb, pavement or gutter.\n\n\tThe schedule of charges shall be based upon verifiable costs of surface replacement or restoration, including inspection costs, direct labor and material costs, retirement costs on direct labor, and departmental and general City overhead applicable to the inspection or the type of work or improvement involved. It shall take into consideration the number of permits issued and affected by those charges within the period of time used for reference in the development of charges. Charges for unimproved areas or areas permanently resurfaced by a permittee, for asphalt concrete pavement, for concrete pavement, gutter, or driveway, and for concrete sidewalks shall be measured at a rate per square foot; for concrete curbs at a rate per linear foot; and for leakage detection holes and for stake holes, at a rate for each hole.\n\n\tThe schedule shall also provide for, and the Board shall collect, a minimum charge applicable to each particular type of work or improvement otherwise in effect under the schedule. The minimum charge shall be calculated on the following basis:\n\n\t(1)\tFor unimproved areas or areas permanently resurfaced by a permittee, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit of 100 square feet of such work;\n\n\t(2)\tFor asphalt concrete pavement, and for a concrete pavement gutter, driveway, or sidewalk, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit of 10 square feet of such work;\n\n\t(3)\tFor concrete curb, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit of 3 linear feet of such work; and\n\n\t(4)\tFor leakage detection and stake holes, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit of 4 holes.\n\n\tbb.\tUpon the adoption of a schedule of verified costs by the Board as provided herein, the Board shall transmit copies of the Board order to the Mayor and to the City Council. At any time within 30 days after the receipt of the Board order, the Mayor, by writing, or the Council, by majority vote, may disapprove the Board order. If neither the Mayor nor the City Council disapproves the Board order within the 30-day period, the schedule shall become effective, and the Board shall collect charges according to the new schedule.\n\n\t2.\tMinimum Charge for Each Type of Resurfacing.\u00a0 The minimum charge for each permit to cover the cost of inspection of the restoration of unimproved areas will only be made when no other type of resurfacing is included in the permits. If another type of resurfacing is included, the charge for inspection of the restoration of unimproved areas will be based upon the actual area excavated times the unit charge for such inspection. The minimum charges for all other types of resurfacing will be made, when applicable, whenever any such resurfacing is actually placed regardless of whether one or more types of resurfacing is involved.\n\n\t3.\tMinimum Charge for a Permit.\u00a0 On permits issued where no resurfacing is actually done, a minimum charge of $31.00 will be made.\u00a0 The fee herein shall be adjusted, if required, in order to recover the City\u2019s administrative costs, and adopted in the same manner as provided in Section 12.37 I.1. of the Los Angeles Municipal Code for establishing fees.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No 168,734, Eff. 5\/31\/93.)\n\n\t(c)\t(Repealed by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9\/28\/12.)\n\n\t(d)\t(Repealed by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9\/28\/12.)\n\n\t(e)\t(Repealed by Ord.

than 1,000 square feet is\n$2.20 per square foot.\t(cc)\tSpecial Inspection Charges.\u00a0 In addition to the\nfees identified in Paragraphs (aa) and (bb) of this Subdivision, the Bureau of\nEngineering may, when the Bureau of Engineering or the Bureau of Contract\nAdministration determines that additional inspections beyond those ordinarily\nrequired in overseeing work permitted by an excavation utility (U) permit or\nexcavation (E) permit are required, charge a fee for additional inspections.\u00a0\nThe fee for conducting additional inspections pursuant to the provisions of this\nParagraph is $95 per hour, except that there will be a minimum four hour charge\nof $380 for inspections on weekends or on any day determined to be a holiday\npursuant to the provisions of

an\nexcavation of 1,000 square feet or less in area where the Bureau of Engineering\ndetermines that due to the complexity of the permitted work it would cost more\nto issue and administer a permit than would be collected pursuant to the\nprovisions of Subdivision 1. of this Subsection, is the actual cost of services\nprovided by the City for issuance and oversight of the permit and the permitted\nproject, except for costs that may be incurred by a Proprietary Department\nsubject to the provisions of Article VI of the City Charter, and except for the\nStreet Damage Restoration Fee and the Slurry Seal Damage Restoration Fee.\u00a0 The\nactual cost determination shall include, but not be limited to, all direct and\nindirect labor costs, retirement and overhead costs, costs for plan checking and\nengineering services, project inspection costs, and the costs of testing\nmaterials.\u00a0 Before the Bureau of Engineering may issue a permit subject to the\nprovisions of this Subdivision, the applicant must deposit with the Bureau an\namount that the Bureau estimates will be the actual costs owed pursuant to the\nprovisions of this Subdivision.\tFor permits and projects that are subject to the\nprovisions of this Subdivision, if before completion of the permitted project\nthe Bureau of Engineering determines that additional funds are needed to\ncompensate the City for the actual cost of issuance and oversight of the permit\nand permitted project, the City may halt all work on the project for which the\napplication was made and require the applicant to pay the amount that the Bureau\nestimates will be needed to compensate the City for the actual cost of providing\nits services.\u00a0 At the conclusion of providing the requested services, if actual\ncosts to the City are less than the amount deposited, the applicant shall be\nrefunded the difference.\u00a0 The City shall not approve any permitted project\nuntil all monies owed pursuant to the provisions of this Subdivision are paid.\u00a0\nNotwithstanding the first sentence of this Subdivision, the City reserves the\nright to impose additional fees and charges for services provided or costs\nincurred

of\n$605.\t(bb)\tFor each de-tensioned anchor rod left in place less than 20 feet\nbelow the street surface within a public right-of-way, a fee of\n$2,040.\t4.\tResurfacing Charges.\u00a0 When an excavation subject to the provisions\nof Paragraph (bb) of Subdivision 1. of this Subsection requires the resurfacing\nof public streets or alleys, or replacing sidewalks, curbs or gutters, the\nBureau of Engineering shall charge and collect applicable fees identified in\nSubsection (b) of Section 62.109.\t(b)\tResurfacing Charges.\t1.\tSchedule of\nFees.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 157,341, Eff. 2\/13\/83.)\taa.\tThe Board, with\nconcurrence of the Director of the Office of Administrative and Research\nServices (Amended by Ord. No. 173,363, Eff. 7\/29\/00, Oper. 7\/1\/00.) shall\ndetermine on a regular basis, the verifiable costs of the City for services\nprovided by the City whenever the improved surface of an excavated or damaged\nstreet is replaced by the Board, or the restoration of an unimproved surface of\na street is subject to inspection by the Board. Those costs shall be used by the\nBoard to develop, and at any time during each fiscal year but not later than\nApril 1 the Board shall adopt a cost recovery schedule of applicable charges\nnecessary to recover City costs of inspection and other services performed with\nrespect to a specific type of work or improvement.\tFor the purposes of this\nsection, the word \u201cexcavation,\u201d or any derivation thereof, shall mean each\nsingle continuous broken surface area of a street, sidewalk, driveway, curb,\npavement or gutter.\tThe schedule of charges shall be based upon verifiable costs\nof surface replacement or restoration, including inspection costs, direct labor\nand material costs, retirement costs on direct labor, and departmental and\ngeneral City overhead applicable to the inspection or the type of work or\nimprovement involved. It shall take into consideration the number of permits\nissued and affected by those charges within the period of time used for\nreference in the development of charges. Charges for unimproved areas or areas\npermanently resurfaced by a permittee, for asphalt concrete pavement, for\nconcrete pavement, gutter, or driveway, and for concrete sidewalks shall be\nmeasured at a rate per square foot; for concrete curbs at a rate per linear\nfoot; and for leakage detection holes and for stake holes, at a rate for each\nhole.\tThe schedule shall also provide for, and the Board shall collect, a\nminimum charge applicable to each particular type of work or improvement\notherwise in effect under the schedule. The minimum charge shall be calculated\non the following basis:\t(1)\tFor unimproved areas or areas permanently resurfaced\nby a permittee, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit\nof 100 square feet of such work;\t(2)\tFor asphalt concrete pavement, and for a\nconcrete pavement gutter, driveway, or sidewalk, a minimum charge equal to the\nCity charge in effect for a unit of 10 square feet of such work;\t(3)\tFor\nconcrete curb, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit of\n3 linear feet of such work; and\t(4)\tFor leakage detection and stake holes, a\nminimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit of 4\nholes.\tbb.\tUpon the adoption of a schedule of verified costs by the Board as\nprovided herein, the Board shall transmit copies of the Board order to the Mayor\nand to the City Council. At any time within 30 days after the receipt of the\nBoard order, the Mayor, by writing, or the Council, by majority vote, may\ndisapprove the Board order. If neither the Mayor nor the City Council\ndisapproves the Board order within the 30-day period, the schedule shall become\neffective, and the Board shall collect charges according to the new\nschedule.\t2.\tMinimum Charge for Each Type of Resurfacing.\u00a0 The minimum charge\nfor each permit to cover the cost of inspection of the restoration of unimproved\nareas will only be made when no other type of resurfacing is included in the\npermits. If another type of resurfacing is included, the charge for inspection\nof the restoration of unimproved areas will be based upon the actual area\nexcavated times the unit charge for such inspection. The minimum charges for all\nother types of resurfacing will be made, when applicable, whenever any such\nresurfacing is actually placed regardless of whether one or more types of\nresurfacing is involved.\t3.\tMinimum Charge for a Permit.\u00a0 On permits issued\nwhere no resurfacing is actually done, a minimum charge of $31.00 will be\nmade.\u00a0 The fee herein shall be adjusted, if required, in order to recover the\nCity\u2019s administrative costs, and adopted in the same manner as provided in\nSection 12.37 I.1. of the Los Angeles Municipal Code for establishing fees.\u00a0\n(Amended by Ord.

Bureau of Engineering may, when the Bureau of Engineering or the Bureau of <span class=\"dictionary\">Contract<\/span> Administration determines that additional inspections beyond those ordinarily required in overseeing work permitted by an excavation utility (U) permit or excavation (E) permit are required, charge a fee for additional inspections.\u00a0 The fee for conducting additional inspections pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph is $95 per hour, except that there will be a minimum four hour charge of $380 for inspections on weekends or on any day determined to be a

applicant must deposit with the Bureau an amount that the Bureau estimates will be the actual costs owed pursuant to the provisions of this Subdivision.<br \/><br \/>\tFor permits and projects that are subject to the provisions of this Subdivision, if before completion of the permitted project the Bureau of Engineering determines that additional funds are needed to compensate the City for the actual cost of issuance and oversight of the permit and permitted project, the City may halt all work on the project for which the application was made and require the applicant to pay the amount that the Bureau estimates will be needed to compensate the City for the actual cost of providing its services.\u00a0 At the conclusion of providing the requested services, if actual costs to the City are less than the amount deposited, the applicant shall be refunded the difference.\u00a0 The City shall not approve any permitted project until all monies owed pursuant to the provisions of this
