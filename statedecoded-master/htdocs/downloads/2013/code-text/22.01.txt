  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS LIMITED TO ORIGINAL PERMITS.	All provisions of this Code
and of any other ordinance of this city which provide that no person shall

do or allow to be done any act, without first obtaining a permit from the Board
so to do, shall be deemed to apply only to those cases wherein original permits
