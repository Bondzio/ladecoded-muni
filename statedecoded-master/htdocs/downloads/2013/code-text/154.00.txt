DECLARATION OF PURPOSE. (§ 154.00)

  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
	(Article and Section Added by Ord. No. 171,761, Eff. 11/30/97.)

	It is the purpose of the provisions of this section to provide a property
management training program to instruct property owners on how to improve the
management of their properties.  Substandard building owners and managers are
not equipped to properly manage these properties.  The training will encompass
marketing, preparing units for rental, repair and maintenance of the property,
techniques on early detection of drug and gang activity on the property and the
use of rental agreements and leases to enforce house rules for proper
management.

	Owners who received substandard orders because of a multitude of habitability
violations or because they have not complied with a Department of Building and
Safety Order to Comply will benefit from the program because these owners often
lack expertise and experience in managing these properties.

	Further, some owners need to recognize that property ownership is a business
enterprise and in order to stay in business, the properties will have to be
managed as a business.  Property management training will be beneficial to
achieve this goal.

	Based on the foregoing reasons, the City Council finds that a property
management training program will improve the management of the rental units in
the City of Los Angeles thereby resulting in better managed housing stock.
