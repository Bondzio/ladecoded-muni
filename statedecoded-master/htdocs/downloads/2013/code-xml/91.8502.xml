&#xA0; ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 176,673, Eff. 7/6/05.)91.8502.1.&#xA0; Use or Occupancy.&#xA0;
When applying this division, Joint Living and Work Quarters shall be classified
as Group R-2 occupancy and comply with all Group R-2 occupancy requirements of
the Code, except as provided in this chapter.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 181,133,
Eff. 5/11/10.)91.8502.1.1.&#xA0; Ceiling Height.&#xA0; Existing ceiling height within a
Joint Living and Work Quarters may be maintained, provided the ceiling height is
not less than seven feet, except that the ceiling height above a mezzanine may
be six feet six inches to any structural projections from the ceiling.&#xA0;
(Amended by Ord. No. 181,133, Eff. 5/11/10.)91.8502.1.2.&#xA0; Emergency Escape.&#xA0;
(Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)&#xA0; Every room below the fourth story
where occupants sleep in Joint Living and Work Quarters shall be provided with
an emergency escape or rescue window or door, which complies with the
requirements of CBC Section 1026. &#xA0;	EXCEPTION:&#xA0; The emergency escape or rescue
window or door may open directly into an existing court, provided:	A.	The court
is accessible to the Fire Department.	B.	The court is provided with a minimum of
one direct exit to a corridor, exit stairway, exit passageway, exterior exit
stairway, exterior exit balcony, or exterior exit ramp, or existing fire
escape.&#xA0; The existing fire escape shall be structurally sound and shall not
serve as an exit for an assembly use.	C.	All openings in walls surrounding the
court shall be protected as required by CBC Section 705.3 or be provided with an
approved water curtain.91.8502.2.&#xA0; Exterior Wall and Exterior Opening
Protection.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)&#xA0; Existing
construction of the exterior walls may be maintained without complying with
current exterior fire resistive wall construction.	Existing unprotected exterior
openings, which are not allowed or are required to be protected due to their
proximity to a property line, may be maintained without complying with the
requirements of CBC Section 705.8 provided the openings are protected with an
approved water curtain.&#xA0; Openings in the exterior walls that are not allowed by
CBC Section 705.8 due to their proximity to a property line, may not be used to
satisfy other code requirements, such as light and ventilation, smoke control or
emergency escape.91.8502.3.&#xA0; Smoke Control System.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No.
179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)&#xA0; Existing high-rise buildings shall
provide a smoke control system in all portions of the building including
basements.&#xA0; The smoke control system shall meet the requirements of CBC Section
909 or all the requirements of this section.	EXCEPTION:&#xA0; The following areas
are exempt:	A.	New or existing rooms less than 50 square feet in area.	B.	New or
existing rooms located at or above grade level provided the room has a direct
exit to the exterior of the building.	C.	Floor levels with openable windows or
breakable tempered glass panels in the exterior walls.&#xA0; The area of the
openable windows or breakable tempered glass panels shall be a minimum of 20
square feet in area.&#xA0; The openable windows or breakable tempered glass panels
shall be located in the exterior walls around the perimeter of the floor no more
than 50 linear feet.91.8502.3.1.&#xA0; Capacity.&#xA0; Smoke-control systems shall
provide at least six air changes per hour for all areas within the building
including basements, provide exhaust to the exterior of the building, and
provide an adequate makeup air supply that is uniformly
distributed.91.8502.3.2.&#xA0; Smoke Dampers.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff.
8/8/11.)&#xA0; If a smoke-control system serves more than one floor, then smoke
dampers shall be installed in the main exhaust air ducts and the main supply air
ducts serving each floor and shall comply with the activation requirements of
C.B.C. Section 716.3.3. The smoke dampers shall be installed in a manner that
will prevent the movement of smoke from one floor to another floor when the
dampers are closed.&#xA0; The vertical risers of the main exhaust air duct shall be
installed in metal ducts complying with the requirements for product-conveying
ducts in Chapters 5 and 6 of the Mechanical Code.	In the firefighter&#x2019;s control
panel, all smoke dampers within the same smoke-control zone shall be actuated by
one On-Auto-Off switch in accordance with CBC Section 909.16.3, except that an
alternate actuation method may be allowed when approved by both the Fire
Department and the Department.	Combination fire and smoke dampers, and smoke
dampers shall be listed to conform to UL 555 and they shall be accessible for
inspection, service and repair.&#xA0; Pneumatic tubing to operate these dampers
shall be of noncombustible materials.91.8502.3.3.&#xA0; Firefighter&#x2019;s Control
Panel.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)&#xA0; The
firefighter&#x2019;s control panel shall comply with all the requirements of CBC
Section, 909.16, except that graphically depicted representation of the building
may be omitted when accepted by the Fire Department.&#xA0; The firefighter&#x2019;s
control panel shall monitor and be capable of overriding the Mechanical Test
Panel.&#xA0; The Mechanical Test Panel is a separate control panel that provides
controls and displays the status of the ventilation fans, dampers, and other
smoke control devices as required by CBC Section&#xA0; 909 and shall be located in
the same room as the Firefighter&#x2019;s Control Panel.91.8502.3.4.&#xA0; Performance
Test.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)&#xA0; Upon
