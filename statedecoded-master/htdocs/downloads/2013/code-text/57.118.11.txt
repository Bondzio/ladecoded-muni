AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEMS. (§ 57.118.11)

  AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEMS.	A.	Every new high-rise building shall be
protected by an automatic sprinkler system installed in conformance to LAFD
Standard No. 59 and the provisions of this subsection.  (Amended by Ord. No.
167,326, Eff. 11/16/91.	B.	Sprinkler control valves and water-flow detecting
devices shall be provided at the lateral connection to the riser on each
floor.  Such valves and devices shall be electrically supervised to
automatically sound an appropriate signal to the building control station.	C.	A
minimum on-site water supply equal to a 20-minute demand or 15,000 gallons,
whichever is the smaller, shall be provided.  This water supply shall be
automatically available for the sprinkler system if the principal water supply
fails.  The riser of the required standpipe system may be combined with the
sprinkler system riser provided the sizing of the riser is sufficient to
accommodate both sprinkler and standpipe demands.	D.	In addition to other
provisions of this article, automatic sprinkler systems shall comply with the
requirements set forth in Chapter 9 of the L.A.M.C. (Building Code).  These
requirements are subject to review by the Chief and any modification granted
thereto shall be subject to concurrence by the Department of Building and
Safety.
