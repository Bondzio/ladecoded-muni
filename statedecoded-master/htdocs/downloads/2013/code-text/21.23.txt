                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

EFFECT OF REPEALS AND AMENDMENTS. (§ 21.23)

  EFFECT OF REPEALS AND AMENDMENTS.	Except where a repealing or amendatory
ordinance specifically provides otherwise, the amendment or repeal of any
portion of Article 1 or Article 1.5 shall not be construed to operate as a
release or waiver of any liability or sum of money which may be due or owing to
the City of Los Angeles from any person under the provisions of said articles as
they existed prior to such amendment or repeal. The rule of construction
required by this section is declared to be in clarification and confirmation of
the existing intent of said articles, and is not to be construed as applying
solely to the effect of repealing or amendatory ordinances adopted subsequent to
the effective date of this section.
