  POOL WATER CLARITY.
	(Added by Ord. No. 172,592, Eff. 6/28/99, Oper. 7/1/99.)	The recirculation and
purification system of any swimming pool, fish pond, or any other body of water
which is required to be fenced by Section 91.6109.1, shall be operated and
maintained so as to keep the water in such pool or other body of water clean and
of reasonable clarity.	In order to define reasonable clarity of the water in
such pool, pond or body of water, the following standard shall be applied:	A
painted black disk, 6 inches in diameter on a 12-inch by 12-inch white tile,
placed at the bottom of the pool at its deepest point, shall be clearly visible
from the sidewalks around the pool from all distances up to 10 yards from such
disk, or the water is determined to not be of reasonable clarity.
