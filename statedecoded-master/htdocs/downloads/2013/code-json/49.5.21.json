bidder of its intention to consider making such a finding.\u00a0 The awarding authority shall offer the bidder an opportunity to present evidence and argument that, despite the bidder having been found to have violated the City law prohibiting the laundering of campaign funds, the awarding authority should not have reason to question the bidder\u2019s integrity and fitness to perform the

the violation, or otherwise exhibits evidence of having accepted such responsibility, or\t(2)\tmitigated the wrongdoing by taking prompt remedial or corrective action, then the City Ethics Commission
