	Between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., in any residential zone of the City or within 500 feet thereof, no person shall operate or cause to be operated any powered equipment or powered hand tool that produces a maximum noise level exceeding the following noise limits at a distance of 50 feet therefrom:

	(a)	75dB(A) for construction, industrial, and agricultural machinery including crawler-tractors, dozers, rotary drills and augers, loaders, power shovels, cranes, derricks, motor graders, paving machines, off-highway trucks, ditchers, trenchers, compactors, scrapers, wagons, pavement breakers, compressors and pneumatic or other powered equipment;

	(b)	75dB(A) for powered equipment of 20 HP or less intended for infrequent use in residential areas, including chain saws, log chippers and powered hand tools;

	(c)	65dB(A) for powered equipment intended for repetitive use in residential areas, including lawn mowers, backpack blowers, small lawn and garden tools and riding tractors;

	The noise limits for particular equipment listed above in (a), (b) and (c) shall be deemed to be superseded and replaced by noise limits for such equipment from and after their establishment by final regulations adopted by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and published in the Federal Register.

	Said noise limitations shall not apply where compliance therewith is technically infeasible&#xA0; The burden of proving that compliance is technically infeasible shall be upon the person or persons charged with a violation of this section. Technical infeasibility shall mean that said noise limitations cannot be complied with despite the use of mufflers, shields, sound barriers and/or other noise reduction device or techniques during the operation of the equipment.</full_text><order_by>05</order_by><ancestry><unit id="80" label="article"><name>Special Noise Sources</name><identifier>2</identifier><url>/11/2/</url></unit><unit id="79" label="chapter"><name>Noise Regulation</name><identifier>11</identifier><url>/11/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="4095"><structure_id>80</structure_id><section_number>112.01</section_number><catch_line>Radios, Television Sets, And Similar Devices.</catch_line><url>/112.01/</url><token>112.01</token></unit><unit id="1874"><structure_id>80</structure_id><section_number>112.02</section_number><catch_line>Air Conditioning, Refrigeration, Heating, Pumping, Filtering Equipment.</catch_line><url>/112.02/</url><token>112.02</token></unit><unit id="3649"><structure_id>80</structure_id><section_number>112.03</section_number><catch_line>Construction Noise.</catch_line><url>/112.03/</url><token>112.03</token></unit><unit id="2360"><structure_id>80</structure_id><section_number>112.04</section_number><catch_line>Powered Equipment Intended For Repetitive Use In Residential Areas And Other Machinery, Equipment, And Devices.</catch_line><url>/112.04/</url><token>112.04</token></unit><unit id="305"><structure_id>80</structure_id><section_number>112.05</section_number><catch_line>Maximum Noise Level Of Powered Equipment Or Powered Hand Tools.</catch_line><url>/112.05/</url><token>112.05</token></unit><unit id="3274"><structure_id>80</structure_id><section_number>112.06</section_number><catch_line>Places Of Public Entertainment.</catch_line><url>/112.06/</url><token>112.06</token></unit></structure_contents><next_section id="3274"><structure_id>80</structure_id><section_number>112.06</section_number><catch_line>Places Of Public Entertainment.</catch_line><url>/112.06/</url><token>112.06</token></next_section><metadata></metadata><references></references><url>/112.05/</url><token>112.05</token><formats><txt>/112.05.txt</txt><json>/112.05.xml</json></formats><dublin_core><Title>Maximum Noise Level Of Powered Equipment Or Powered Hand Tools.</Title><Type>Text</Type><Format>text/html</Format><Identifier>&#xA7; 112.05</Identifier><Relation>Los Angeles Municipal Code</Relation></dublin_core><plain_text>                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE
