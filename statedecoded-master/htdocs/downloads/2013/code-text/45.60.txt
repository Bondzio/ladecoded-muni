                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (§ 45.60)

  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

	After public hearing receipt of testimony, the City Council finds and declares:

	That discrimination against tenants on the basis of their status as students
exists in the City of Los Angeles;

	That there is a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the City of
Los Angeles;

	That students, who generally do not have the economic resources to buy homes,
must often lie in close proximity to their campus so they can commute between
their school, their home and their job; however, because of discrimination on
the basis of their status as student, these students are forced to live further
from campus than would otherwise be necessary;

	That such discrimination cuts across all racial, ethnic and economic lines;

	That because housing is a fundamental necessity of life, it is against the
public policy of the City of Los Angeles to discriminate in rental housing upon
the basis of a tenant’s status as a student.
