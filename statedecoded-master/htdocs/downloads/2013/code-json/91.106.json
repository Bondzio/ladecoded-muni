If the Initial Study and Check List identifies the historical or cultural asset as significant, the permit shall not be issued without the department first finding that specific economic, social or other considerations make infeasible the preservation of the building or structure.\n\n91.106.4.6.\u00a0 Notification and Posting in a Hillside Grading Area.\n\n91.106.4.6.1.\u00a0 In any area designated as a hillside grading area, the department shall not issue (1) a building permit for construction of a building with over 500 square feet of floor area, or (2) a building permit for any addition to an existing building which adds over 500 square feet of floor area, or (3) a grading permit for the grading of more than 1,000 cubic yards of earth materials without having first done the following at least 10 days prior to issuance of the building or grading permit:\n\n\t1.\tThe department shall send written notices of the permit application, by mail, to the owners of all property abutting the property at which the construction or grading will occur.
