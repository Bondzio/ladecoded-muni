plants, buildings, structures, or equipment.	(g)	No Surface Mining Operations
shall be conducted on any property except between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8
p.m., except in case of an emergency or whenever any reasonable or necessary
repairs to equipment are required to be made. Surface Mining Operations in an
M-3 zone and more than 1,200 feet from any residential use may be conducted
between the hours of 5 a.m. and 10 p.m.	(h)	Every Operator, before commencing
Surface Mining Operations within any District, shall be insured to the extent of
$500,000 against liability arising from Surface Mining Operations or activities
incidental to them.&#xA0; The insurance shall be kept in full force and effect
during the period of Surface Mining Operations, including Reclamation.	(i)	In
granting Surface Mining Operations Permits, the Commission or Council:	(1)	Shall
