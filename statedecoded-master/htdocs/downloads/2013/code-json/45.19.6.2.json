No. 181,704, Eff. 5\/13\/11.)\n\n\t3.\tThe total population of the City, the population of the Community Plan Areas, and whether the citywide and Community Plan Area caps meet the needs of qualified patients, persons with identification cards, and their primary caregivers may be reviewed and the caps may be amended by ordinance after notice and hearing by the City Council.\u00a0 Nothing contained in this article shall be interpreted or deemed to grant or guarantee to any collective, including but not limited to those that meet the requirements set forth in Section 45.19.6.2 B.2. and those granted a priority order pursuant to Section 45.19.6.2 C., the ability to find a location in the Community Plan Area of its choice or within the City more generally that complies with the preinspection requirements set forth in Section 45.19.6.3 since the requirements for each collective, including, but not limited to its address and square footage, as well as its ability to find a willing lessor and to pay rent, are attributes unique to each collective and are beyond the control of the City.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

No. 181,530, Eff. 1\/28\/11.)\n\n\tThe City Clerk\u2019s determinations of eligibility, ineligibility, and priority order pursuant to this Temporary Urgency Ordinance shall be final and shall be based exclusively on the required forms and documentary proof submitted under penalty of perjury by the collective pursuant to this section, and upon such other government or utility records as may be obtained by the City Clerk that support or contradict the documents submitted by the collective.\u00a0 Any collective that disputes the City Clerk\u2019s decision that it is ineligible to continue to be considered for preinspection and registration shall personally deliver its notice of challenge to the City Clerk within five business days after the date on which the City Clerk posted its determination of the collective\u2019s ineligibility on its website.\u00a0 Late challenges will not be accepted.\u00a0 The notice of challenge must be signed under penalty of perjury by the collective.\u00a0 The names of all collectives who submit such challenges shall be provisionally added to the names of eligible collectives for the initial drawing of 100 collective names by the City Clerk.\u00a0 If at any time thereafter a court agrees with the City Clerk\u2019s original determination of ineligibility of the collective, the collective shall be removed from any and all City priority order and preinspection lists, shall be disqualified from all further participation in the original and any subsequent drawings, priority order, preinspection, and registration processes for those collectives determined to be eligible under this subsection, and shall immediately cease operation pursuant to Section 45.19.6.7.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,530, Eff. 1\/28\/11.)\n\n\t2.\tIf at any time after 540 days following the June 7, 2010 effective date of this article, the total number of registered collectives in the City falls below 70, the City Clerk shall hold, at such time as the City Clerk determines in its sole discretion, additional drawings for the purpose of determining the priority order in which the Department of Building and Safety will consider preinspection and registration of additional collectives.\u00a0 Each such drawing shall select the number of collective names for preinspection that would bring the total number of registered collectives in the City to 70, and shall select only from the names of eligible collectives that were not previously drawn pursuant to Subsection C.1. above, until all such eligible collective names have been drawn.\u00a0 Once all of the eligible collective names have been drawn, any collective that notifies the City Clerk within one week after the publication of the date of a priority drawing and pays a fee of $50.00 to the City Clerk and a fee of $151.00 to the Los Angeles Police Department for each owner and\/or member engaged in the management shall be eligible to participate in the drawings.\u00a0 However, no collective may participate in a drawing if one or more of its owners or members engaged in its management were convicted currently or within the previous 10 years of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude, or are currently on parole or probation for the sale or distribution of a controlled substance.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

Once the Department of Building and Safety has determined that the maximum number of collectives authorized by Subsection B. of this section complies, the Department of Building and Safety shall stop determining the compliance of more collectives.\u00a0 Any collective not in compliance with the requirements of Section 45.19.6.3 A. of this article, as determined by the Department of Building and Safety, or not considered for compliance because the cap had already been met, shall be notified by the Department of Building and Safety that it is disqualified from the preinspection and registration process and that it may enter any future drawing conducted in accordance with Subsection C., above.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,157, Eff. 6\/7\/10.)\n\n\tE.\tNotice of Preinspection.\u00a0 Prior to accepting a request for preinspection, the Department of Building and Safety shall require proof that the collective has provided written notice to the Police Department, all property owners and occupants within and outside the City that are within 1,000 feet of the exterior boundaries of the location, and to the City Council member of the district in which the collective is proposed to be located, the Certified Neighborhood Council, and any Business Improvement District (\u201cBID\u201d) representing the area in which the collective is located, of: the preinspection request; the proposed location of the collective; the name, telephone number, and address of a person authorized to accept service of process for the collective; the name(s), telephone number(s), and address(es) of each member engaged in the management of the collective; and the onsite telephone number at the collective and the name of the member engaged in the management of the collective who is responsible for receiving, logging, and responding to complaints regarding the collective.\u00a0 This notification shall be sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, and return receipt requested.\u00a0 Notices to property owners shall be sent to the last known name and address as shown on the records of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor; notices to occupants of all residential, commercial and industrial property can be mailed to \u201coccupant\u201d.\u00a0 Proof of mailing shall be established if the collective files an affidavit of mailing with the Department of Building and Safety certifying the date on which the notice was sent, a copy of the notice, and a complete list of the names and addresses where the notice was sent.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff. 4\/10\/11.)\n\n\tF.\tRegistration Form.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.
