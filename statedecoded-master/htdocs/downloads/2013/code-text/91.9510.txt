EQUIVALENT LATERAL FORCE PROCEDURE. (§ 91.9510)

  EQUIVALENT LATERAL FORCE PROCEDURE.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,260, Eff. 8/30/96.)91.9510.1.  General.  Structures
shall be analyzed for prescribed forces acting concurrently on the orthogonal
axes of the building.  The effects of the loading on the two orthogonal axes
shall be combined as required by Section 91.9509.1.91.9510.2.  Base Shear for
Analysis.  (Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)  The base shear used to
determine story drifts shall be determined using 75 percent of that currently
required by Section 12.8.1 of the ASCE 7.	WHERE:	R	=	1.4 for concrete frame
buildings with masonry infill and all other reinforced concrete buildings.
 	EXCEPTION:  R = 1.0 for single story buildings.	The R value in Table 12.2-1
of ASCE 7 of this Code for new building design shall not be used for story drift
determination.91.9510.3.  Structure Period.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324,
Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  The fundamental period of the structure, T, in
the direction under consideration can be calculated by Equation 12.8-7 of ASCE 7
or using the structural properties and deformational characteristics of the
resisting elements in a properly substantiated analysis without subject to the
limitations established by Table 12.8-1 of ASCE 7.91.9510.4.  Vertical
Distribution of Forces.  (Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)  The base
shear shall be distributed over the height of the structure in conformance with
Formula (10-1).			(10-1)WHERE:	Cvx	=	vertical distribution factor to be applied
to V to obtain the story force at level x.	K	=	an exponent related to building
period as follows:For buildings having a period of 0.5 seconds or less, k =
1.0For buildings having a period of 2.5 seconds or more, k = 2.0For buildings
having a period between 0.5 and 2.5 seconds, k may be taken as two or determined
by linear interpolation between one and two.91.9510.5.  Horizontal Distribution
of Shear.  The effective stiffness of elements shall be used for the horizontal
distribution of shear.91.9510.6.  Horizontal Torsional Moments.  Provision
shall be made for increased displacements resulting from horizontal torsion. 
The effects of torsional moments shall be included in the determination of the
effective stiffness of elements and systems.  Reinforced concrete floors may be
considered as rigid diaphragms.91.9510.7.  Effective Stiffness.  The effective
stiffness of concrete and masonry elements shall be determined as prescribed in
Section 91.9509.4.91.9510.8.  Material Characteristics.  Material
characteristics shall be determined as prescribed in Section
91.9509.6.91.9510.9.  Story Drift Limitations.  Story drift limits shall be as
prescribed in Section 91.9509.7.91.9510.10.  Compressive Strain
Determination.  Compressive strain shall be determined as prescribed in Section
91.9509.8.91.9510.11.  Shear Strength Limitation.  The in-plane shear strength
shall equal or exceed the shear forces determined as prescribed in Section
91.9509.9.
