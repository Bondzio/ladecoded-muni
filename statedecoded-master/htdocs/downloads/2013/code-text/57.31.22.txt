ENGINE FUEL TANK. (§ 57.31.22)

  ENGINE FUEL TANK.	A.	Every engine fuel tank shall be approved by the Chief
and equipped with an approved emergency vent of sufficient size to properly
relieve any internal pressure which might be created from exposure to heat or
fire.	B.	Every engine fuel tank shall be so installed that the top is lower than
the fuel pump or carburetor on any such engine.	C.	No fuel supply pipe shall be
installed except in the top of the tank. The fuel supply system shall be
installed so that broken pipes or loose connections will not permit leakage from
the fuel tank.	D.	Unless located in an approved fire resistive room, any fuel
tank located inside of, or on the roof of a building shall be limited to 25
gallons capacity for gasoline and 60 gallons capacity for diesel.	E.	When
installed within two feet of an exhaust manifold or pipe, the fuel tank shall be
protected against heat by a metal baffle or equivalent insulation.	F.	Every pump
which supplies any engine fuel tank shall be provided with an interlock device
so that the pump may operate only when the engine being supplied is in
operation.
