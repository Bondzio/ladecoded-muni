No. 170,068, Eff. 11\/18\/94.)\n\n\t(a)\tThe Board may levy monetary penalties in addition to or in lieu of suspension of franchise or operating permit pursuant to 71.02 above.\u00a0 Monetary penalties may be levied on a per violation, a per day or an accumulated penalty point basis and may escalate on a first, second, or third violation basis.\u00a0 Deficiencies in operations which endanger the public health, welfare, and\/or safety shall receive the maximum penalties.\n\n\t(b)\tThe Board shall adopt by resolution a schedule of monetary penalties, a procedure for assessing monetary penalties or penalty points for specific driver and\/or operator violations, and an appeal procedure.\u00a0 Monetary penalties for taxicab operators shall be no more than $1,000 for each penalty point over an established limit, or for each day, as appropriate, up to a maximum of $25,000 in monetary penalties for penalty points accumulated in a calendar quarter; except penalties assessed on a per day basis for failure to correct operator deficiencies shall accumulate without limit for each day that the violation exists.\u00a0 Any single penalty assessment that exceeds $30,000 is subject to appeal to the City Council.\n\n\t(c)\tPayment of a monetary penalty or the serving of a suspension shall constitute a waiver of the right to further appeal of any monetary penalty or suspension to the City Council or Superior Court.\n\n\t(d)\tJudicial review of an action by the Board levying such monetary penalty or of an action of the City Council in denying an appeal, as provided for herein, shall be available only if a petition for a writ of mandate is filed in the Superior Court not later than the 90th day following the date upon which the decision of the Board or City Council becomes final, which shall be the expiration of the period during which reconsideration can be sought, provided that if reconsideration is sought the decision is final for the purposes of this section on the date that reconsideration is rejected.\n\n\t(e)\tThe total monetary penalty payment is due by the date established by the Board or 30 days after the end of the month in which payment has accrued, whichever comes first.\u00a0 The payment is delinquent if not paid on or before the due date.\n\n\t(f)\tA penalty of 10% of the amount of the payment shall be assessed on any payment which has become delinquent.\u00a0 Failure to pay any delinquent payment on or before the last day of the fourth month following the date on which the payment first became delinquent will result in the assessment of a second penalty of 10% of the amount of the payment in addition to the amount of the payment and the 10% penalty first imposed.\n\n\t(g)\tIn addition to the penalties imposed above, failure to pay any payment required by ordinance and by the franchise or operating permit will result in the assessment of interest charges at the rate of 1-1\/2% per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the payment, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the payment first became delinquent until it is paid.","order_by":"02.2","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"51","name":"Public
