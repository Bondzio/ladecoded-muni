No. 173,168, Eff. 5\/18\/00, Oper. 11\/15\/00.)\n\n\tThe City Council finds that there exists a serious pet overpopulation problem within the City, that has resulted in a threat to public safety and health, inhumane treatment of animals, mass euthanasia of dogs\/cats at the local animal shelters and escalating costs for animal care and control.\u00a0 Further, the Board of Animal Services Commissioners has found that uncontrolled breeding is the cause and, without action aimed at the source, this problem and its serious consequences will remain unabated.\u00a0 Council finds that part of the solution is for all dogs and cats over the age of four months to be spayed or neutered, unless their owners purchase the appropriate licenses\/permits for the privilege of maintaining the animal intact and allowing it to breed.\u00a0 Council also finds that an increase in the license fee for unaltered dogs will encourage the owners to spay\/neuter their dog(s), in order to qualify for the much lower altered dog license fee.\u00a0 Further, Council finds that tighter regulation of the transfer of dogs and cats will help alleviate the City\u2019s pet overpopulation crisis by allowing increased City control over the transfer of dogs and cats.\n\n\t(a)\tAnimal Ownership:\n\n\tAnimal Owner, for purposes of this section, shall mean any person harboring, keeping or providing care or sustenance to a domestic animal for 30 or more consecutive days on property which he\/she owns, rents or leases.\u00a0 Such a person shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.\u00a0 This definition does not apply to government agencies, animal rescue organizations which have demonstrated to the Department that they have implemented an ongoing spay\/neuter program as well as an adoption program, or humane societies or societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals if such societies are incorporated under the provisions of California Corporations Code Section 10400 and the Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law in Part 2 of the California Corporations Code, beginning at Section 5110 and successor sections.\n\n\t(b)\tIntact Dogs and Cats:\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 179,615, Eff. 4\/8\/08.)\n\n\t(1)\tNo person who owns a cat over the age of four months shall cause, permit, or allow the cat to be in a public place unsupervised, unless the cat is spayed or neutered.\u00a0 The term public place shall include, but not be limited to, streets, highways, sidewalks, carnivals, shopping malls, flea markets, boardwalks, and areas in front of commercial establishments.\u00a0 This requirement applies to all unaltered cats, whether or not their owner(s) have obtained breeding permits pursuant to Subsection (c), below.\n\n\t(2)\tNo person, within the City of Los Angeles, shall own a dog or cat over the age of four months that has not been spayed or neutered, unless valid written documentation is provided to show proof that the animal is exempt from the requirement to be spayed or neutered by reason of one of the following, and is in compliance with Subdivisions (3) and (4) below:\n\n\tA.\tThe dog or cat is a breed approved by and is registered with a registry or association recognized by the Department through its Commission, whose program and practices are consistent with the humane treatment of animals, and the dog or cat is actively used to show or compete and has competed in at least one show or sporting competition hosted by or under the approval of the recognized registry or association within the last two years, or is being trained or groomed to show or compete and is too young to have yet competed.\n\n\tB.\u00a0 The dog has earned, or if under three years old, is actively being trained and in the process of earning, an agility, carting, herding, protection, rally, hunting, working, or other title from a registry or association approved by the Department through its Commission.\n\n\tC.\tThe dog is being trained or has been appropriately trained and is actively used in a manner that meets the definition of guide, signal or service dog as set forth in Subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) of Section 365.5 of the Penal Code, or the dog is enrolled in a guide, signal or service dog breeding program administered by a person licensed under Chapter 9.5 (commencing with Section 7200) of Division 3 of the California Business and Professions Code.\n\n\tD.\tThe dog is appropriately trained or is in the process of being trained and is actively used by law enforcement agencies or the military for law enforcement, military or rescue activities.\n\n\tE.\tThe owner of the dog or cat provides a letter to the Department from a licensed veterinarian certifying that the animal\u2019s health would be best served by spaying or neutering after a specified date; or that due to age, poor health, or illness it is unsafe to spay or neuter the animal; or that arrangements have been made to spay or neuter the dog or cat within 60 days after the compliance deadline and the dog or cat is spayed or neutered within that 60-day period.\u00a0 This letter shall include the veterinarian\u2019s license number, the date by which the animal may be safely spayed or neutered, and updated periodically as necessary.\u00a0 In addition, if the letter from the licensed veterinarian certifies that arrangements have been made to spay or neuter the dog within 60 days from the date the dog reaches the age of four months, and the dog is spayed or neutered within that 60-day period, the owner shall qualify for the lower license fee and license tax for an altered dog.\u00a0 It shall be the owner\u2019s responsibility to comply with the spay\/ neuter provisions of this chapter, including paying the license fee and license tax.\n\n\tF.\tThe dog or cat has a valid breeding permit issued to the owner pursuant to Subsection (c) below.\n\n\t(3)\tAn unaltered dog or cat shall be implanted with an animal identification device identifying the owner of the animal.\n\n\t(4)\tIn addition to meeting one of the exemptions in this section, the dog license application for an unaltered dog shall contain the information requested by the Department, including the identification number of the implanted animal identification device, the name and address of the owner, and the location at which the dog will be maintained.\n\n\t(5)\tA license for an unaltered dog shall not be transferable, and shall not be issued to any person under the age of eighteen years.\n\n\t(6)\tThe provisions of this subsection become operative on October 1, 2008.\u00a0 However, an unaltered dog that has a valid dog license from the Department shall not be subject to this subsection until the dog license expires, or October 1, 2009, whichever occurs first.\n\n\t(7)\tAny person owning, possessing, harboring or having custody and control of a cat or dog in violation of this subsection shall be given a notice to comply and information regarding free and subsidized spay and neuter services.\u00a0 If the violation is not corrected within 60 days, it shall be deemed a second violation and in addition to correcting the violation, the person shall pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100.00 or shall be allowed to perform eight hours of community service.\u00a0 Failure to pay the civil penalty or perform the community service and\/or failure to correct the violation within the 60-day period, or any extension of that period permitted by the Department, shall be deemed a third violation.\u00a0 The Department shall impose a civil penalty in the amount of $500.00 or allow the person to perform 40 hours of community service, in addition to spaying or neutering the dog or cat.\n\n\tAfter July 1, 2009, if after 60 days from the date of notification of a third violation, the $500.00 civil penalty is not paid or the 40 hours of community service is not performed and\/or the owner still has not spayed\/neutered his\/her dog(s) or cat(s) as required under Subsection (b) above, the continuing violation of this subsection may also be deemed a misdemeanor.\n\n\t(8)\tThere is hereby established an Animal Services Spay\/Neuter Advisory Committee (Committee) for the purpose of advising the Board of Animal Services Commissioners on the impact of the City\u2019s spay\/neuter policies on the City\u2019s low-income residents.\u00a0 The Committee shall seek regular and systematic input on its recommendations, especially from low-income residents.\n\n\tA.\tThe membership of the Committee shall consist of 15 persons appointed by the City Council, with each Councilmember appointing one person to the Committee.\n\n\tB.\tThe General Manager of the Department, or his or her designee, shall serve as a non-voting Secretary of the Committee.\n\n\tC.\tThe Committee shall select one of its members to be the chair of the Committee.\u00a0 The chair will also be the conduit between the Committee and the Commission, and if needed, with the Mayor and the City Council.\n\n\tD.\tAll proceedings of the Committee shall be subject to the provisions of California Government Code Section 54950, et seq., as amended (Brown Act).\n\n\tE.\tThe Committee shall meet as frequently as necessary but at least four times during the year.\u00a0 The meetings of the Committee may be conducted by teleconference as provided in the Brown Act.\n\n\tF.\tThe members of the Committee shall serve without compensation, including any travel or per diem expenses.\n\n\tG.\tThe Committee shall complete its work and dissolve by October 30, 2009.\n\n\tH.\tThe Committee shall do the following:\n\n\t(1)\tReview the impact of the spay\/ neuter policies on the City\u2019s low-income residents.\u00a0\n\n\t(2)\tReview the number of animals spayed\/neutered, total exemptions provided, the waiting list if any for the spay\/neuter services, the amount and timing of committed funding, and recommendations for legislative and administrative action needed to ensure that funding is allocated promptly to qualified providers of the spay\/neuter programs.\n\n\t(3)\tReview the quality of services and accountability measures.\n\n\t(4)\tReview challenges faced by the spay\/neuter program that impede the provision of best possible services.\n\n\t(5)\tMake recommendations on any improvements and changes to the spay\/ neuter program that will enhance its services and reduce the financial burden of the program on residents in low-income areas.\n\n\t(6)\tProvide a preliminary written report containing an evaluation of the program and any recommendations to the Commission, and provide a copy to the Mayor and the City Council by March 30, 2009, and a final report by October 30, 2009.\n\n\t(c)\tBreeding Permit:\n\n\t(1)\tNo person shall cause or allow any dog or cat owned, harbored or kept within the City of Los Angeles to breed without first obtaining a breeding permit,

breeding permit shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance, and may be renewed annually, before its expiration date.\u00a0 Each applicant for such a permit shall pay an annual fee of $235.00 or such other fee established in the manner set forth in Subsection (a) of Section 53.12 and promulgated by the Department.\u00a0 A separate permit must be obtained for each owned dog or cat that is allowed to breed.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,341, Eff. 11\/14\/10.)\n\n\t(3)\tThe Department shall administer an animal breeding permit program to allow the breeding of unaltered dogs and cats consistent with criteria and according to procedures established by the General Manager pursuant to Section 53.58 of this Code.\u00a0 Under no circumstances shall such a permit be issued to a person who has been convicted of animal cruelty or neglect.\n\n\t(4)\tIn addition to the criteria and procedures established by the General Manager pursuant to Paragraph 3 of this subsection, all breeding permits shall contain the following terms and conditions:\n\n\tA.\tThe owner of an unaltered female dog or cat shall not allow the whelping of more than one litter in any household within the permit year.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this provision, the General Manager is hereby authorized, upon application of a permittee, to allow on a one time basis the whelping of up to two dog or cat litters per breeding animal within any domestic household within a permit year, if the permittee establishes, according to regulations promulgated by the General Manager, that such breeding is required to protect the health of the animal or avert a substantial economic loss to the permittee.\u00a0 In the event that a permittee is forced to euthanize a litter of dogs or cats, the General Manager may authorize the whelping of one additional litter of dogs or cats within the same permit year by the permittee;\n\n\tB.\tNo offspring may be sold, adopted, bartered, or otherwise transferred, whether for compensation or otherwise, until it has reached the age of at least eight weeks;\n\n\tC.\tNo offspring may be sold or adopted until immunized against common diseases.\u00a0 The sale or adoption of a dog or cat shall include a statement signed by the seller or adopter attesting to the signatory\u2019s knowledge of the animal\u2019s health, and the animal\u2019s immunization history;\n\n\tD.\tAny holder of a breeding permit who advertises to the public the availability of any dog or cat for sale, adoption, or transfer, whether for compensation or otherwise, must prominently display the permit number in any such advertisement.\u00a0 Further, the breeding permit holder must provide the permit number to any person who purchases, adopts or receives any animal from the permit holder and include the permit number on any receipt of sale or transfer document;\n\n\tE.\tCommercial establishments selling locally bred dogs or cats shall prominently display the breeding permit number(s) of the breeder(s) whose dogs and cats are sold in said establishments and any other pertinent information required by the General Manager;

MUNICIPAL CODE\n\nBREEDING AND TRANSFER OF DOGS AND CATS. (\u00a7 53.15.2)\n\n\u00a0 BREEDING AND TRANSFER OF DOGS AND CATS.\n\t(Amended by Ord. No. 173,168, Eff. 5\/18\/00, Oper. 11\/15\/00.)\tThe City Council\nfinds that there exists a serious pet overpopulation problem within the City,\nthat has resulted in a threat to public safety and health, inhumane treatment of\nanimals, mass euthanasia of dogs\/cats at the local animal shelters and\nescalating costs for animal care and control.\u00a0 Further, the Board of Animal\nServices Commissioners has found that uncontrolled breeding is the cause and,\nwithout action aimed at the source, this problem and its serious consequences\nwill remain unabated.\u00a0 Council finds that part of the solution is for all dogs\nand cats over the age of four months to be spayed or neutered, unless their\nowners purchase the appropriate licenses\/permits for the privilege of\nmaintaining the animal intact and allowing it to breed.\u00a0 Council also finds\nthat an increase in the license fee for unaltered dogs will encourage the owners\nto spay\/neuter their dog(s), in order to qualify for the much lower altered dog\nlicense fee.\u00a0 Further, Council finds that tighter regulation of the transfer of\ndogs and cats will help alleviate the City\u2019s pet overpopulation crisis by\nallowing increased City control over the transfer of dogs and cats.\t(a)\tAnimal\nOwnership:\tAnimal Owner, for purposes of this section, shall mean any person\nharboring, keeping or providing care or sustenance to a domestic animal for 30\nor more consecutive days on property which he\/she owns, rents or leases.\u00a0 Such\na person shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.\u00a0 This definition\ndoes not apply to government agencies, animal rescue organizations which have\ndemonstrated to the Department that they have implemented an ongoing spay\/neuter\nprogram as well as an adoption program, or humane societies or societies for the\nprevention of cruelty to animals if such societies are incorporated under the\nprovisions of California Corporations Code Section 10400 and the Nonprofit\nPublic Benefit Corporation Law in Part 2 of the California Corporations Code,\nbeginning at Section 5110 and successor sections.\t(b)\tIntact Dogs and Cats:\u00a0\n(Amended by Ord. No. 179,615, Eff. 4\/8\/08.)\t(1)\tNo person who owns a cat over\nthe age of four months shall cause, permit, or allow the cat to be in a public\nplace unsupervised, unless the cat is spayed or neutered.\u00a0 The term public\nplace shall include, but not be limited to, streets, highways, sidewalks,\ncarnivals, shopping malls, flea markets, boardwalks, and areas in front of\ncommercial establishments.\u00a0 This requirement applies to all unaltered cats,\nwhether or not their owner(s) have obtained breeding permits pursuant to\nSubsection (c), below.\t(2)\tNo person, within the City of Los Angeles, shall own\na dog or cat over the age of four months that has not been spayed or neutered,\nunless valid written documentation is provided to show proof that the animal is\nexempt from the requirement to be spayed or neutered by reason of one of the\nfollowing, and is in compliance with Subdivisions (3) and (4) below:\tA.\tThe dog\nor cat is a breed approved by and is registered with a registry or association\nrecognized by the Department through its Commission, whose program and practices\nare consistent with the humane treatment of animals, and the dog or cat is\nactively

California Business and Professions Code.\tD.\tThe dog\nis appropriately trained or is in the process of being trained and is actively\nused by law enforcement agencies or the military for law enforcement, military\nor rescue activities.\tE.\tThe owner of the dog or cat provides a letter to the\nDepartment from a licensed veterinarian certifying that the animal\u2019s health\nwould be best served by spaying or neutering after a specified date; or that due\nto age, poor health, or illness it is unsafe to spay or neuter the animal; or\nthat arrangements have been made to spay or neuter the dog or cat within 60 days\nafter the compliance deadline and the dog or cat is spayed or neutered within\nthat 60-day period.\u00a0 This letter shall include the veterinarian\u2019s license\nnumber, the date by which the animal may be safely spayed or neutered, and\nupdated periodically as necessary.\u00a0 In addition, if the letter from the\nlicensed veterinarian certifies that arrangements have been made to spay or\nneuter the dog within 60 days from the date the dog reaches the age of four\nmonths, and the dog is spayed or neutered within that 60-day period, the owner\nshall qualify for the lower license fee and license tax for an altered dog.\u00a0 It\nshall be the owner\u2019s responsibility to comply with the spay\/ neuter provisions\nof this chapter, including paying the license fee and license tax.\tF.\tThe dog or\ncat has a valid breeding permit issued to the owner pursuant to Subsection (c)\nbelow.\t(3)\tAn unaltered dog or cat shall be implanted with an animal\nidentification device identifying the owner of the animal.\t(4)\tIn addition to\nmeeting one of the exemptions in this section, the dog license application for\nan unaltered

this subsection become operative on October 1,\n2008.\u00a0 However, an unaltered dog that has a valid dog license from the\nDepartment shall not be subject to this subsection until the dog license\nexpires, or October 1, 2009, whichever occurs first.\t(7)\tAny person owning,\npossessing, harboring or having custody and control of a cat or dog in violation\nof this subsection shall be given a notice to comply and information regarding\nfree and subsidized spay and neuter services.\u00a0 If the violation is not\ncorrected within 60 days, it shall be deemed a second violation and in

violation.\u00a0 The\nDepartment shall impose a civil penalty in the amount of $500.00 or allow the\nperson to perform 40 hours of community service, in addition to spaying or\nneutering the dog or cat.\tAfter July 1, 2009, if after 60 days from the date of\nnotification of a third violation, the $500.00 civil penalty is not paid or the\n40 hours of community service is not performed and\/or the owner still has not\nspayed\/neutered his\/her dog(s) or cat(s) as required under Subsection (b) above,\nthe continuing violation of this subsection may also be deemed a\nmisdemeanor.\t(8)\tThere is hereby established an Animal Services Spay\/Neuter\nAdvisory Committee (Committee) for the purpose of advising the Board of Animal\nServices Commissioners on the impact of the City\u2019s spay\/neuter
