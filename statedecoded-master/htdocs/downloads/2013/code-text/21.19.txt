DELINQUENT TAXES – SUIT FOR RECOVERY. (§ 21.19)

  DELINQUENT TAXES – SUIT FOR RECOVERY.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 180,358, Eff. 12/20/08.)	(a)	Any tax required to be paid
under the provisions of this article, shall be deemed a debt owed to the City. 
Any person engaging in a business required to obtain a registration certificate
and pay a business tax who fails to obtain such certificate shall be liable from
the date they became subject to the tax, but in no event shall such person be
liable for a period greater than eight (8) years.  Any person owing any tax
under the provision of this article shall be liable in an action brought in the
name of the City of Los Angeles in any court of competent jurisdiction for
recovery of any such amount. 	(b)	An action to collect the business tax and any
related penalty and interest must be commenced within three years of the date
the business tax becomes delinquent.  The statute of limitations on an action
by the City to collect unpaid taxes is tolled while the City is unaware of the
existence or ongoing activities of a business due to the taxpayer’s failure to
obtain a registration certificate and pay a business tax.  The statute of
limitations is also tolled while an administrative appeal is pending.
