ADDITIONAL REMEDIAL MEASURES. (§ 91.7109)

  ADDITIONAL REMEDIAL MEASURES.91.7109.1.  General Remedial Measures.  In the
event the concentration of methane gas in any building located in a Methane Zone
or Methane Buffer Zone reaches or exceeds 25 percent of the minimum
concentration of gas that will form an ignitable mixture with air at ambient
temperature and pressure, the owner shall hire an engineer to investigate,
recommend and implement mitigating measures.  These measures shall be subject
to approval of this Department and the Fire Department.91.7109.2.  Abandoned
Oil Well.  Any abandoned oil well encountered during construction shall be
evaluated by the Fire Department and may be required to be re-abandoned in
accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the Division of Oil, Gas and
Geothermal Resources of the State of California.  Buildings shall comply with
these provisions and the requirements of Section 91.6105 of this Code, whichever
is more restrictive.TABLE 71.  MINIMUM METHANE MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS
