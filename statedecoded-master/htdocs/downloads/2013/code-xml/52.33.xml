	(b)	Issuance Restricted.&#xA0; No uniform City Attorney badge shall be issued to or be used, worn or carried by any person, unless the employee&#x2019;s duties involve the active enforcement of law, or unless the employee performs other public duties which, in the judgment of the City Attorney are such as to require that the employee wear or carry a badge for purposes of identification.

	(c)	Managing Officers &#x2013; Issuance and Records of Badges.&#xA0; Uniform City Attorney badges shall be issued only by the City Attorney.&#xA0; Such badges shall be consecutively numbered.&#xA0; The City Attorney shall keep records showing the number of each badge, the date of its issuance, and the name and residence address of the person to whom issued.&#xA0; Each badge shall remain the property of the City and must be returned to the City Attorney at the conclusion of the holder&#x2019;s service or upon the holder being assigned duties not requiring the use of the badge.

	(d)	Reimbursement Required.&#xA0; Each employee to whom a badge is issued must reimburse the City for the cost thereof if the badge be lost or destroyed through the employee&#x2019;s negligence, or if the badge be not turned in to the City Attorney at the termination of employment.

	(e)	Retired Officers and Employees.&#xA0; When the holder of any badge, the use of which is authorized under this section, is honorably retired, the same or another badge may be reissued to the retiree, provided there be permanently affixed thereto to engraved or embossed thereon, at his expense, the word &#x201C;RETIRED&#x201D;
