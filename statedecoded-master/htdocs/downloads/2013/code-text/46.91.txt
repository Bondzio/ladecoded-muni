TOBACCO RETAILER’S PERMITREQUIRED. (§ 46.91)

  TOBACCO RETAILER’S PERMIT  REQUIRED.
	(Title and Section Amended by Ord. 179,436, Eff. 1/28/08.)	(a)	It shall be a
misdemeanor for any person or proprietor, within the City of Los Angeles, to act
as a tobacco retailer at a location for which a valid Tobacco Retailer’s
Permit has not been issued pursuant to this article.  A separate Tobacco
Retailer’s Permit is required for each location at which tobacco retailing is
to occur.  No permit shall be issued to authorize tobacco retailing at any
place other than a fixed location.  Tobacco retailing from any non- permanent
location, including from vehicles, is prohibited.  No permit shall be issued
for residences, newsstands, or locations where engaging in tobacco retailing is
prohibited by federal, state or local law.	(b)	A person or proprietor without a
valid Tobacco Retailer’s Permit, including a person or proprietor whose permit
has been suspended, shall keep all tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia
out of public view.  The public display of tobacco products or tobacco
paraphernalia in violation of this provision shall constitute tobacco retailing
without a permit.	(c)	Each day that a person or proprietor sells or offers for
sale tobacco, tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia without a valid Tobacco
Retailer’s Permit shall constitute a separate violation.
