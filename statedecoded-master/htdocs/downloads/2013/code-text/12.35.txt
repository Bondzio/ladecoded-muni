ZONING OF ANNEXED OR UNZONED AREAS. (§ 12.35)

  ZONING OF ANNEXED OR UNZONED AREAS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,268, Eff. 7/1/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)	All land or territory
annexed to the City after the effective date of this section shall be
immediately classified in the R1 Zone and in Height District No. 1 (R1-1) unless
the Council specifically determines otherwise by ordinance.  The Council may
establish specific zoning by ordinance for land or territory to be annexed. 
The zoning ordinance may be adopted concurrently with the annexation.  Unless
the specific zoning is established by ordinance, the Zoning Map shall be amended
to indicate the land or territory annexed as R1-1 without additional
proceedings.	Any land or territory in the City which is not indicated on the
Zoning Map as being in any zone shall be construed as being classified in the
same zone as that existing on the side of the street opposite the subject land
or territory, and the Zoning Map is hereby amended to indicate that zone without
additional procedure.	In those portions of the City where height districts have
been established, any land or territory which is not indicated on the Zoning Map
as being in any height district shall be construed as being classified in the
same height district as that existing on the side of the street opposite the
subject land or territory, and the Zoning Map is hereby amended to indicate that
height district without additional procedure.	Where uncertainty exists as to the
zone or height district to be indicated on the map, the zone or height district
shall be determined by the City Planning Commission by written decision.
