99.05.303.1.    Separate meters or metering devices shall be installed for
uses described in Sections 5.303.1.1 and 5.303.1.2.99.05.303.2.  Twenty Percent
Savings.  A schedule of plumbing fixtures and fixture fittings that will reduce
the overall use of potable water within the building by 20 percent shall be
provided.  The reduction shall be based on the maximum allowable water use per
plumbing fixture and fittings as required by the California Building Standards
Code.  The 20 percent reduction in potable water use shall be demonstrated by
one of the following methods:	1.	Each plumbing fixture and fitting shall meet
the 20 percent reduced flow rate specified in Table 5.303.2.3, or	2.	A
calculation demonstrating a 20 percent reduction in the building “water use
baseline” as established in Table 5.303.2.2 shall be provided.99.05.303.2.1. 
Multiple Showerheads Serving One Shower.  When single shower fixtures are
served by more than one showerhead, the combined flow rate of all the
showerheads shall not exceed the maximum flow rates specified in the 20 percent
reduction column contained in Table 5.303.2.2 or the shower shall be designed to
only allow one showerhead to be in operation at a time.	EXCEPTION: The maximum
flow rate for shower heads when using the calculation method specified in
Section 99.05.303.2, Item 2 is 2.5 gpm @ 80 psi.TABLE 5.303.2.2
