NON-OPERATING LANDFILLS. (§ 191.07)

  NON-OPERATING LANDFILLS.	A.	It shall be unlawful for owners of non-operating
landfills to fail to monitor and control decomposition gases if the Department
has properly notified the owner of the owner’s monitoring or control
requirements.  The Department will provide notice when it has cause to believe
that a landfill site not presently operating, whether or not ever permitted by
the City, is a hazard or a nuisance as a result of the migration of
decomposition gases from landfill in excess of state regulations.  The
Department may require the owner to monitor the site according to specifications
adopted by the Department, with monitoring results submitted to the Department
and any other appropriate agency as directed by the Department.  If the
Department determines that monitoring is required the monitoring shall be done
by and at the expense of the owner and/or operator.  The owner/operator may
request a hearing pursuant to Public Resource Code Sections 44305 and
44310.	B.	If the owner and/or operator refuse to conduct monitoring as provided
in Subsection A. or fail to conduct the monitoring within a reasonable time as
determined by the Department, the City or a contractor selected by the City
shall conduct monitoring with all reasonable costs assessed to and owed by the
owner/operator.
