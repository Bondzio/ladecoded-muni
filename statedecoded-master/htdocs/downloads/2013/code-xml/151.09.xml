	(Amended by Ord. No. 154,237, Eff. 8/30/80, Oper. 9/1/80.)

	A.	A landlord may bring an action to recover possession of a rental unit only upon one of the following grounds:

	1.	The tenant has failed to pay the rent to which the landlord is entitled, including amounts due under Subsection D of Section 151.05.

	2.	(Amended by Ord. No. 175,130, Eff. 3/31/03.)&#xA0; The tenant has violated a lawful obligation or covenant of the tenancy and has failed to cure the violation after having received written notice from the landlord, other than a violation based on:

	(a)	The obligation to surrender possession upon proper notice; or

	(b)	The obligation to limit occupancy, provided that the additional tenant who joins the occupants of the unit thereby exceeding the limits on occupancy set forth in the rental agreement is either the first or second dependent child to join the existing tenancy of a tenant of record or the sole additional adult tenant.&#xA0; For purposes of this section, multiple births shall be considered as one child.&#xA0; The landlord, however, has the right to approve or disapprove the prospective additional tenant, who is not a minor dependent child, provided that the approval is not unreasonably withheld; or

	(c)	A change in the terms of the tenancy that is not the result of an express written agreement signed by both of the parties.&#xA0; For purposes of this section, a landlord may not unilaterally change the terms of the tenancy under Civil Code Section 827 and then evict the tenant for the violation of the added covenant unless the tenant has agreed in writing to the additional covenant.&#xA0; The tenant must knowingly consent, without threat or coercion, to each change in the terms of the tenancy.&#xA0; A landlord is not required to obtain a tenant&#x2019;s written consent to a change in the terms of the tenancy if the change in the terms of the tenancy is authorized by Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 151.06, or if the landlord is required to change the terms of the tenancy pursuant to federal, state, or local law.&#xA0; Nothing in this paragraph shall exempt a landlord from providing legally required notice of a change in the terms of the tenancy.

	3.	(Amended by Ord. No. 180,449, Eff. 2/5/09.)&#xA0; The tenant is committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in or is causing damage to, the rental unit or to the unit&#x2019;s appurtenances, or to the common areas of the complex containing the rental unit, or is creating an unreasonable interference with the comfort, safety, or enjoyment of any of the other residents of the rental complex or within a 1,000 foot radius extending from the boundary line of the rental complex.

	5.	The tenant, who had a written lease or rental agreement which terminated on or after the effective date of this chapter, has refused, after written request or demand by the landlord to execute a written extension or renewal thereof for a further term of like duration with similar provisions and in such terms as are not inconsistent with or violative of any provision of this chapter or any other provision of law.

	6.	The tenant has refused the landlord reasonable access to the unit for the purpose of making repairs or improvements, or for the purpose of inspection as permitted or required by the lease or by law, or for the purpose of showing the rental unit to any prospective purchaser or mortgagee.

Added by Ord. No. 177,901, Eff. 9/29/06.)

	11.

A landlord who attempts to re-rent a unit, but refuses to allow a tenant to return to her/his home under this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.&#xA0; Any person who violates this subsection shall also be liable in a civil action for damages and/or injunctive relief, if appropriate, together with reasonable attorneys&#x2019; fees and costs as determined by the court.

	7.	The landlord&#x2019;s offers and notices required shall be given in the manner prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162 or by certified mail.&#xA0; The tenant shall give any acceptance or notice by first class mail or by utilizing the procedures set forth in Section 1162 at the tenant&#x2019;s option.&#xA0; If any notice, offer, or acceptance is given by mail, then the postmark date shall be deemed the date of that notice, offer, or acceptance.

	8.	The Rent Stabilization Division shall attempt to notify affected tenants and landlords of the provisions of the ordinance and may devise any forms it deems necessary to implement the ordinance for use by landlords and tenants.&#xA0; The Rent Adjustment Commission shall have the authority to promulgate any rules and regulations it deems necessary to implement the ordinance.

	9.	The provisions of this subsection shall apply to tenants regardless of whether or not their security deposits were returned in accordance with state law.

EVICTIONS. (&#xA7; 151.09)

&#xA0; EVICTIONS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 154,237, Eff. 8/30/80, Oper. 9/1/80.)	A.	A landlord may
bring an action to recover possession of a rental unit only upon one of the
following grounds:	1.	The tenant has failed to pay the rent to which the
landlord is entitled, including amounts due under Subsection D of Section
151.05.	2.	(Amended by Ord. No. 175,130, Eff. 3/31/03.)&#xA0; The tenant has
violated a lawful obligation or covenant of the tenancy and has failed to cure
the violation after having received written notice from the landlord, other than
a violation based on:	(a)	The obligation to surrender possession upon proper
notice; or	(b)	The obligation to limit occupancy, provided that the additional
tenant who joins the occupants of the unit thereby exceeding the limits on
occupancy set forth in the rental agreement is either the first or second
dependent child to join the existing tenancy of a tenant of record or the sole
additional adult tenant.&#xA0; For purposes of this section, multiple births shall
be considered as one child.&#xA0; The landlord, however, has the right to approve or
disapprove the prospective additional tenant, who is not a minor dependent
child, provided that the approval is not unreasonably withheld; or	(c)	A change
in the terms of the tenancy that is not the result of an express written
agreement signed by both of the parties.&#xA0; For purposes of this section, a
landlord may not unilaterally change the terms of the tenancy under Civil Code
Section 827 and then evict the tenant for the violation of the added covenant
unless the tenant has agreed in writing to the additional covenant.&#xA0; The tenant
must knowingly consent, without threat or coercion, to each change in the terms
of the tenancy.&#xA0; A landlord is not required to obtain a tenant&#x2019;s written
consent to a change in the terms of the tenancy if the change in the terms of
the tenancy is authorized by Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 151.06, or if
the landlord is required to change the terms of the tenancy pursuant to federal,
state, or local law.&#xA0; Nothing in this paragraph shall exempt a landlord from
providing legally required notice of a change in the terms of the
tenancy.	3.	(Amended by Ord. No. 180,449, Eff. 2/5/09.)&#xA0; The tenant is
committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in or is causing damage to, the
rental unit or to the unit&#x2019;s appurtenances, or to the common areas of the
complex containing the rental unit, or is creating an unreasonable interference
with the comfort, safety, or enjoyment of any of the other residents of the
rental complex or within a 1,000 foot radius extending from the boundary line of
the rental complex.	The term &#x201C;nuisance&#x201D; as used in this subdivision
includes, but is not limited to, any gang-related crime, violent crime, unlawful
weapon or ammunition crime or threat of violent crime, illegal drug activity,
any documented activity commonly associated with illegal drug dealing, such as
complaints of noise, steady traffic day and night to a particular unit,
barricaded units, possession of weapons, or drug loitering as defined in Health
and Safety Code Section 11532, or other drug related circumstances brought to
the attention of the landlord by other tenants, persons within the community,
law enforcement agencies or prosecution agencies.&#xA0; For purposes of this
subdivision, gang-related crime is any crime motivated by gang membership in
which the perpetrator, victim or intended victim is a known member of a gang.&#xA0;
Violent crime is any crime which involves use of a gun, a deadly weapon or
serious bodily injury and for which a police report has been completed.&#xA0; A
violent crime under this subdivision shall not include a crime that is committed
against a person residing in the same rental unit as the person committing the
crime.&#xA0; Unlawful weapon or ammunition crime is the illegal use, manufacture,
causing to be manufactured, importation, possession, possession for sale, sale,
furnishing, or giving away of ammunition or any weapon listed in subdivision
(c)(1)-(5) of Section 3485 of the Civil Code.	Threat of violent crime is any
statement made by a tenant, or at his or her request, by his or her agent to any
person who is on the premises or to the owner of the premises, or his or her
agent, threatening the commission of a crime which will result in death or great
bodily injury to another person, with the specific intent that the statement is
to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out,
when on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, it is so
unequivocal, immediate and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a
gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and
thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own
safety or for his or her immediate family&#x2019;s safety.&#xA0; Such a threat includes
any statement made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic
communication device and regarding which a police report has been completed.&#xA0; A
threat of violent crime under this section shall not include a crime that is
committed against a person who is residing in the same rental unit as the person
making the threat.&#xA0; &#x201C;Immediate family&#x201D; means any spouse, whether by
marriage or not, parent, child, any person related by consanguinity of affinity
within the second degree, or any other person who regularly resides in the
household, or who, within the prior six months, regularly resided in the
household.&#xA0; &#x201C;Electronic communication device&#x201D; includes but is not limited
to, telephones, cellular telephones, video recorders, fax machines, or pagers.&#xA0;
&#x201C;Electronic communications&#x201D; has the same meaning as the term is defined in
subsection 12 of Section 2510 of Title 18 of the United States Code, except that
&#x201C;electronic communication&#x201D; for purposes of this definition shall not be
limited to electronic communication that affects interstate or foreign
commerce.	Illegal drug activity is a violation of any of the provisions of
Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 11350) or Chapter 6.5 (commencing with
Section 11400) of the Health and Safety Code.	4.	(Amended by Ord. No. 171,442,
Eff. 1/19/97.)&#xA0; The tenant is using, or permitting a rental unit, the common
areas of the rental complex containing the rental unit, or an area within a
1,000 foot radius from the boundary line of the rental complex to be used for
any illegal purpose.	The term &#x201C;illegal purpose&#x201D; as used in this subdivision
includes, but is not limited to, violations of any of the provisions of Chapter
6 (commencing with Section 11350) or Chapter 6.5 (commencing with section 11400)
of the Health and Safety Code.	5.	The tenant, who had a written lease or rental
agreement which terminated on or after the effective date of this chapter, has
refused, after written request or demand by the landlord to execute a written
extension or renewal thereof for a further term of like duration with similar
provisions and in such terms as are not inconsistent with or violative of any
provision of this chapter or any other provision of law.	6.	The tenant has
refused the landlord reasonable access to the unit for the purpose of making
repairs or improvements, or for the purpose of inspection as permitted or
required by the lease or by law, or for the purpose of showing the rental unit
to any prospective purchaser or mortgagee.	7.	The person in possession of the
rental unit at the end of a lease term is a subtenant not approved by the
landlord.	8.	(Amended by Ord. No. 180,747, Eff. 8/1/09.)&#xA0; The landlord seeks in
good faith to recover possession of the rental unit for use and occupancy as a
primary place of residence by:	(a)	The landlord; or	(b)	The landlord&#x2019;s spouse,
grandchildren, children, parents or grandparents; or&#xA0;	(c)	A resident
manager.	Landlords seeking to recover possession pursuant to the provisions of
this Subdivision must comply with the restrictions and requirements of Section
151.30, as well as all other relevant provisions of this Article.	9.	(Amended by
Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)&#xA0; The landlord, having complied with all
applicable notices and advisements required by law, seeks in good faith to
recover possession so as to undertake Primary Renovation Work of the rental unit
or the building housing the rental unit, in accordance with a Tenant
Habitability Plan accepted by the Department, and the tenant is unreasonably
interfering with the landlord&#x2019;s ability to implement the requirements of the
Tenant Habitability Plan by engaging in any of the following actions:	a.	The
tenant has failed to temporarily relocate as required by the accepted Tenant
Habitability Plan; or	b.	The tenant has failed to honor a permanent relocation
agreement with the landlord pursuant to Section 152.05 of this
Code.	10.	(Amended by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)&#xA0; The landlord seeks in
good faith to recover possession of the rental unit under either of the
following circumstances:&#xA0;	a.	to demolish the rental unit; or	b.	to remove the
rental unit permanently from rental housing use.	Landlords seeking to recover
possession for either of the circumstances described in this subdivision must
comply with the requirements of Sections 151.22 through 151.28 of this
article.&#xA0; This subdivision is a lawful grounds for eviction only where a
landlord is withdrawing from rent or lease all of the rental units in a
structure or building.&#xA0; A landlord seeking to evict tenants pursuant to either
of the circumstances described in this subdivision may not withdraw from rent or
lease less than all of the accommodations in a structure or building.&#xA0; (Para.
Added by Ord. No. 177,901, Eff. 9/29/06.)	11.	The landlord seeks in good faith
to recover possession of the rental unit in order to comply with a governmental
agency&#x2019;s order to vacate, order to comply, order to abate, or any other order
that necessitates the vacating of the building housing the rental unit as a
result of a violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code or any other provision
of law.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 172,288, Eff. 12/17/98.)	12.	The Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development is both the owner and plaintiff and seeks to
recover possession in order to vacate the property prior to sale and has
complied with all tenant notification requirements under federal law and
administrative regulations.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 173,224, Eff. 5/11/00.)
&#xA0;	13.	The rental unit is in a Residential Hotel, and the landlord seeks to
recover possession of the rental unit in order to Convert or Demolish the unit,
as those terms are defined in Section 47.73 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.&#xA0;
A landlord may recover possession of a rental unit pursuant to this paragraph
only after the Department has approved an Application for Clearance pursuant to
the provisions of Section 47.78.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 180,175, Eff.
9/29/08.)	14.	The landlord seeks to recover possession of the rental unit to
convert the subject property to an affordable housing accommodation in
accordance with an affordable housing exemption issued by the Department
pursuant to Section 151.02 of this Code.&#xA0; If the landlord fails to record a
government imposed regulatory agreement within six months of the filing of the
affordable housing exemption with the Department in accordance with Section
151.02 of this Code, and the landlord seeks to offer the rental unit for rent or
lease, the accommodations shall be offered and rented or leased at the lawful
rent in effect at the time the affordable housing exemption was filed with the
Department, plus annual adjustments available pursuant to Section 151.06 of this
Code.&#xA0; Furthermore, the landlord shall first offer to rent or lease the unit to
the tenant(s) displaced from that unit pursuant to this Subdivision, provided
that the tenant(s) advised the landlord in writing within 30 days of
displacement of his or her desire to consider an offer to renew the tenancy and
provided the landlord with an address to which that offer is to be directed.&#xA0;
The tenant(s) may subsequently advise the landlord of a change of address to
which an offer is to be directed.&#xA0; A landlord who re-offers the rental unit
pursuant to the provisions of this Subdivision shall deposit the offer in the
United States mail, by registered or certified mail with postage prepaid,
addressed to the displaced tenant(s) at the address furnished to the landlord as
provided in this Subdivision, and shall describe the terms of the offer.&#xA0; The
displaced tenant(s) shall have 30 days from the deposit of the offer in the mail
to accept the offer by personal delivery of that acceptance to the Department or
deposit of the acceptance in the United States mail by registered or certified
mail with postage prepaid.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 181,744, Eff. 7/15/11.)	B.	If
the dominant intent of the landlord in seeking to recover possession of a rental
unit is retaliation against the tenant for exercising his or her rights under
this chapter or because of his or her complaint to an appropriate agency as to
tenantability of a rental unit, and if the tenant is not in default as to the
payment of rent, then the landlord may not recover possession of a rental unit
in any action or proceeding or cause the tenant to quit involuntarily.&#xA0;
(Amended by Ord. No. 161,865, Eff. 1/19/87.)	C.	(Amended by Ord. No. 156,597,
Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)&#xA0; Prior to or at the same time as the written
notice of termination described in Civil Code Section 1946, or the three days&#x2019;
notice described in Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1161 and 1161a, is served
on the tenant of a rental unit:	1.	The landlord shall serve on the tenant a
written notice setting forth the reasons for the termination with specific facts
to permit a determination of the date, place, witnesses and circumstances
concerning the reason.&#xA0; This notice shall be given in the manner prescribed by
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162.	2.	When the termination of tenancy is
based on the grounds set forth in Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of this
Section, the landlord shall file with the Department a declaration on a form and
in the number prescribed by the Department identifying the person to be moved
into the rental unit, the date on which the person will move in, the rent
presently charged for the rental unit, and the date of the last rental
increase.&#xA0; This declaration shall be served on the tenant in the manner
prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162 in lieu of the notice
required in Subdivision 1. of this Subsection.&#xA0; When filing the declaration,
the landlord shall pay an administrative fee in the amount of $75.&#xA0; The fee
shall pay for the cost of administering and enforcing the provisions of Section
151.30 of this Code.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 180,747, Eff. 8/1/09.)	3.	When a
termination of tenancy is based on the ground set forth in Section 151.09 A.9.
of this Code, the landlord shall file with the Department a declaration on a
form prescribed by the Department that sets forth the address of the rental
unit, the name of the tenant, a copy of the Tenant Habitability Plan accepted by
the Department, documentation of the landlord&#x2019;s good faith efforts to provide
notice pursuant to Section 152.00 et seq. of this Code, documentation of efforts
to provide relocation assistance, if applicable, and the reason for the
termination with specific facts, including but not limited to the date, place,
witnesses and circumstances concerning the reason for termination.&#xA0; This
declaration shall be served on the tenant in the manner prescribed by Section
1162 of the California Code of Civil Procedure in lieu of the notice required in
Subdivision 1. of this subsection.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff.
5/2/05.)	4.	When the termination of the tenancy is based on either of the
grounds set forth in Subdivision 10. of Subsection A. of this section, the
landlord must comply with the requirements of Sections 151.22 through 151.28 of
this article.&#xA0; The requirements of Sections 151.22 through 151.28 of this
article are in lieu of the notice required in Subdivision 1. of this
subsection.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 177,901, Eff. 9/29/06.)	5.	When the
termination of tenancy is based on the ground set forth in Subdivision 11. of

landlord shall also pay the City a fee for the purpose of providing relocation

associated with this service.&#xA0; The fees, set forth above, may be increased in
an amount based on the Consumer Price Index &#x2013; All Urban Consumers averaged for
the first 12-month period ending September 30, of each year, as determined and
published by the Housing Department on or before May 30, of each year, pursuant
to Section 151.07 A.6. of this Code.&#xA0; The Relocation Assistance Service
Provider will provide the relocation assistance services listed in Sections
47.06 D. and 47.07 D. of this Code.	2.	The landlord shall perform the acts
described in this subsection within fifteen days of service of a written notice
of termination described in California Civil Code Section 1946; provided,
however, the landlord may in its sole discretion, elect to pay the monetary
relocation benefits to be paid to a tenant pursuant to this subsection to an
escrow account to be disbursed to the tenant upon certification of vacation of
the rental housing unit. The escrow account shall provide for the payment prior
to vacation of all or a portion of the monetary relocation benefits for actual
relocation expenses incurred or to be incurred by the tenant prior to vacation,
including but not limited to security deposits, moving expense deposits and
utility connection charges.&#xA0; Escrow accounts shall provide that, in the event
of disputes between the landlord and the tenant as to the release of funds from
escrow, the funds in dispute shall be released to the Department for final
determination.&#xA0; The Rent Adjustment Commission shall establish guidelines for
the establishment of these escrow accounts, the certification of vacation and
pre-vacation disbursement requests.	3.	The requirement to pay relocation
assistance is applicable to all rental units, regardless of whether the rental

tenancy is based on the grounds set forth in Subdivision 10. of Subsection A. of
this section.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)	d.	The landlord
seeks in good faith to recover possession of the rental unit for use and
occupancy by a resident manager, provided that the resident manager is replacing
the existing resident manager in the same unit.&#xA0; For the purposes of this
exception, a resident manager shall not include the landlord, or the
landlord&#x2019;s spouse, grandchildren, children, parents or grandparents;&#xA0; (Second
Sentence Amended by Ord. No. 180,747, Eff. 8/1/09.)	e.	The landlord seeks in
good faith to recover possession of the rental unit in order to comply with a
governmental agency&#x2019;s order to vacate the building housing the rental unit due
to hazardous conditions caused by a natural disaster.	H.	In any action by a
landlord to recover possession of a rental unit, the tenant may raise as an

liable in a civil action to the tenant to whom such assistance is due for
damages in the amount the landlord has failed to pay, together with reasonable
attorney fees and costs as determined by the court.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No.

landlord shall file with the Department a declaration on a form prescribed by
the Department within ten calendar days of the re-rental of the rental unit.&#xA0;

shall indicate the address of the rental unit, the date of the re-rental, the
amount of rent being charged to the current tenant, the name of the current
tenant and such further information as requested by the Department.&#xA0; (Amended

if the landlord desires to re-rent that unit, then, prior to offering the unit
to any other tenant and within 30 days after completion of repairs to the unit,
the landlord shall offer in writing to the tenant the same unit under the same
terms and conditions as existed prior to her/his displacement, except that the

has been completed.&#xA0; The tenant who desires to reoccupy the rental unit shall
furnish the landlord with the tenant&#x2019;s current address and shall notify the
landlord in writing of any change of address.&#xA0; If a tenant is unable to
ascertain an address of the landlord to which the notice can be sent, the tenant

applicable time periods described, the landlord shall be free to offer the unit
to any tenant, subject to the requirements of the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance.	6.	A landlord who attempts to re-rent a unit, but refuses to allow a

of actually carrying it out, when on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, it is so unequivocal, immediate and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family&#x2019;s safety.&#xA0; Such a threat includes any statement made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device and regarding which a police report has been completed.&#xA0; A threat of violent &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;crime&lt;/span&gt; under this section shall not include a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;crime&lt;/span&gt; that is committed against a person who is residing in the same rental unit as the person making the threat.&#xA0;

(Amended by Ord. No. 171,442, Eff. 1/19/97.)&#xA0; The tenant is using, or permitting a rental unit, the common areas of the rental complex containing the rental unit, or an area within a 1,000 foot radius from the boundary line of the rental complex to be used for any illegal purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	The term &#x201C;illegal purpose&#x201D; as used in this subdivision includes, but is not limited to, violations of any of the provisions of Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 11350) or Chapter 6.5 (commencing with section 11400) of the Health and Safety Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	5.	The tenant, who had a written lease or rental agreement which terminated on or after the effective date of this chapter, has refused, after written request or demand by the landlord to execute a written extension or renewal thereof for a further term of like duration with similar provisions and in such terms as are not inconsistent with or violative of any provision of this chapter or any other provision of &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;law&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	6.
