Roof Outlets.\u00a0 Standpipe systems shall be designed so that all risers can be flushed through outlets located on the roof.\t11.2.3.2. Flow.\u00a0 All standpipe risers shall be flushed individually through the roof at residual pressure of at least 65 psi until the system is clear of debris.\u00a0 The flow for Class I and Class III standpipes shall be at least 500 g.p.m. through each riser.94.2020.25. NFPA 14-2007 Section 11.5.6.3 is added and modified to read as follows:\t11.5.6.3. Pressure Regulator Valve Test.\t11.5.6.3.1. Test Required.\u00a0 When required by the Department, 2-1\/2 inch pressure regulator valves installed on standpipe outlets shall be tested for proper operation at a flow of 300 g.p.m. with a residual pressure of 125 psi in the presence of a representative of the Department.\t11.5.6.3.2. Safety.\u00a0 Test nozzles and other equipment shall be adequately secured so as to eliminate danger to personnel.\t11.5.6.3.3. Opening.\u00a0 An accessible 2-1\/2 inch capped or plugged test opening shall be installed adjacent to each pressure regulator valve.\t11.5.6.3.4. Drain.\u00a0 The test openings shall drain to a minimum 3-inch drain line constructed and installed as required for fire sprinkler drains.\u00a0 The drains shall not discharge where they may cause damage.\u00a0 Where available, drains shall terminate to the fire water storage tank.\u00a0\t11.5.6.3.5.
