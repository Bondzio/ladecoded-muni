PERMIT FEES FOR TREE REMOVAL. (§ 62.171)

  PERMIT FEES FOR TREE REMOVAL.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 166,973, Eff. 7/1/91.)	A fee shall be charged for each
permit issued by the Board for the removal or cutting down of any tree in or
upon any street or parkway in the City.  Such permit fee shall provide for the
removal or cutting down of ten (10) or less trees.  Any permit for removal or
cutting down of more than ten (10) trees shall require an additional fee for
each additional unit of ten (10) trees, or any fraction thereof. Such permit
shall specifically describe the work to be done, and shall be void thirty (30)
days from the date of issuance.  No fee shall be charged for any permit to
plant any tree, shrub or plant.	The Board shall waive any permit fee required by
this section for the removal of a live parkway tree if it determines that the
root system of the tree is a primary cause of any sidewalk, curb, driveway,
sewer or structure repair required.	The fees herein shall be determined and
adopted in the same manner as provided in Section 12.37I1 of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code for establishing fees.
