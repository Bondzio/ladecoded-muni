                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

INCONSISTENT PERMITS AND LICENSES. (§ 11.02)

  INCONSISTENT PERMITS AND LICENSES.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 134,358, Eff. 6/8/67.)	Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Code or any other ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, no
permit or license shall be issued in violation of any provisions of this Code or
any other ordinance of the City of Los Angeles; if any permit or license is
issued in violation of any provision of this Code or any other ordinance of the
City of Los Angeles the same shall be void. Any permit or license issued, which
purports to authorize the doing of any act prohibited by any other provision of
this Code or any other ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, shall be void.
Provided, however, that upon publication of a zone change, height district or
building line ordinance the Superintendent of Building may issue a permit for a
building or structure which will comply with all of the requirements of the new
zone, height district or building line. No such permit shall be issued unless
the applicant has first executed and filed with the Superintendent of Building a
notarized agreement assuming all risk and agreeing to remove all buildings or
structures authorized by the permit in the event the zone change, height
district or building line ordinance should become effective.
