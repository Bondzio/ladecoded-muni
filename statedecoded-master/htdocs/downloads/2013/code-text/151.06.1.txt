SMOKE DETECTORS. (§ 151.06.1)

  SMOKE DETECTORS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 154,808, Eff. 2/1/81.)	A.	For a rental unit in which the
landlord installs smoke detectors pursuant to Section 91.8603.1.1 or Section
91.8603.1.2 or Section 91.8603.2.1 or Section 91.8603.2.2 of this Code: 
(Amended by Ord. No. 181,744, Eff. 7/15/11.)	The rent may be increased 50 cents
($.50) per month for each battery operated smoke detector installed in the
rental unit, or three dollars ($3) per month for each permanently installed
smoke detector in the rental unit, or the landlord may apply for a rent
adjustment pursuant to Subsection A of Section 151.07 of this chapter.  This
surcharge shall not constitute a rent increase for purposes of Section 151.06 of
this chapter.	B.	This rent surcharge may be collected at the above rate until
the actual cost to the landlord of purchase and installation has been
recovered.  This subsection shall not apply to a rental unit which becomes
eligible for a rent increase pursuant to Section 151.06 C. of this chapter
subsequent to the installation of the smoke detector.  The Commission shall
promulgate regulations on what constitutes eligible expenses in computing such
actual cost.	C.	Within two months after installation, or by May 31, 1981,
whichever is later, the landlord must give written notice to the tenant paying
the surcharge of the actual purchase and installation costs of the smoke
detector and the month and year when said costs will have been completely
amortized.
