FINDING. (§ 69.00)

  FINDING.

	The Council of the City of Los Angeles hereby finds that the Marina del Rey
Entrance Channel is a unique portion of the City of Los Angeles and requires
special rules and regulations which cannot properly be applicable to any other
portion of the City of Los Angeles. The reason for said uniqueness is that the
Marina del Rey Entrance Channel is owned by the County of Los Angeles but is
located within the City of Los Angeles. It is the means whereby small boats
traverse from the Pacific Ocean into the Marina del Rey, a small boat harbor
owned and operated by the County of Los Angeles and located within
unincorporated territory. The provisions of this article shall be applicable
only to the Marina del Rey Entrance Channel.
