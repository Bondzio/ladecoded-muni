	(Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 180,670, Eff. 6/15/09.)

94.1219.1. Definitions.&#xA0; For purposes of this section, certain terms shall be defined as follows:

	Downstream of the Gas Utility Meter shall refer to all customer-owned gas piping, downstream of the by-pass valve, as specified by the public gas utility company.

	Excess Flow Shut Off Valve shall mean a shut off system activated by significant gas leaks or overpressure surges downstream of the valve.

	Residential Building shall mean any single family dwelling, duplex, apartment building, condominium, townhouse, lodging house, congregate residence, or hotel or motel.

	Seismic Gas Shut Off Valve shall mean a system consisting of a seismic sensing means and actuating means designed to automatically actuate a companion gas shut off means installed in a gas piping system in order to shut off the gas downstream of the location of the gas shut off means in the event of a severe seismic disturbance.&#xA0; The system may consist of separable components or may incorporate all functions in a single unit.

	Upstream of the Gas Utility Meter shall refer to all gas piping installed by the utility up to and including the meter and the utility&#x2019;s bypass tee at the connection to the customer owned piping.

94.1219.2. Scope.&#xA0; An approved seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve shall be installed downstream of the gas utility meter on each fuel gas line where the gas line serves the following buildings or structures:

94.1219.2.1. A building or structure containing fuel gas piping for which a building permit was first issued on or after September 1, 1995.

94.1219.2.2. An existing building or structure which is altered or added to; and

94.1219.2.2.1. That building or structure has fuel gas piping supplying the existing building or structure or the addition to the building or structure; and

94.1219.2.2.2. The alteration or addition is valued at more than $10,000 and a building permit for the work in commercial buildings was first issued on or after September 1, 1995.&#xA0; Alterations or additions to individual units or tenant spaces shall require a seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve to be installed for all gas piping serving that individual unit or tenant space; or

94.1219.2.2.3. The alteration or addition is valued at more than $10,000 and a building permit for the work in residential buildings, including condominium units, is first issued on or after January 10, 1998.&#xA0; Alterations or additions to an individual condominium unit shall require a seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve to be installed for all gas piping serving that individual condominium unit; or

94.1219.2.2.4. The alteration or addition is to the fuel gas piping system and involves the alteration or replacement of the gas meter.

94.1219.2.3. Prior to entering into an agreement of sale, or prior to the close of escrow when an escrow agreement has been executed in connection with the sale:

	(1)	Buildings or structures which contain fuel gas piping shall have a seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve installed.

	(2)	The sale of an individual condominium unit in a building shall require the installation of a seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve for all gas piping serving that individual unit.

	EXCEPTIONS:

	(1)	Seismic gas shut off valves or excess flow shut off valves may be installed upstream of a gas utility meter provided they meet the requirements of this section.

	(2)	Seismic gas shut off valves or excess flow shut off valves installed on a building or structure prior to September 1, 1995, are exempt from the requirements of this section provided they remain installed on the building or structure and are maintained for the life of the building or structure.

	(3)	Notwithstanding Subsections 94.1219.2.1, 94.1219.2.2 and 94.1219.2.3 above, these provisions shall not apply to a building or structure if the Department determines that a building or structure satisfies all three of the following criteria:

	(A)	That the building or structure is owned, operated, and maintained by a governmental entity or public utility; or that the building or structure is owned by a private concern and provides a public benefit, such as a co-generation facility which shares its excess power with a public utility or with a large industrial facility which has governmental contracts;

	(B)	That the building or structure has available 24-hour, year-round, maintenance staffing; and

	(C)	That the gas piping system contained in the building or structure is designed to withstand seismic effects of earthquakes.

	(4)	A single seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve may be installed upstream of the gas utility meter at the discretion of the gas utility.

94.1219.3. General Requirements.&#xA0; Seismic gas shut off valves or excess flow shut off valves installed either in compliance with Section 94.1219.2, et seq., or voluntarily with a permit issued on or after September 1, 1995, shall comply with the following requirements:

94.1219.3.1. Seismic gas shut off valves or excess flow shut off valves shall be installed by a contractor licensed in the appropriate classification by the State of California.

	EXCEPTION:&#xA0; A person who has been determined by the Department to meet the qualification of a Qualified Installer pursuant to the definition of a Qualified Installer set forth in Division 2 of this Code may install a seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve to a single family dwelling which is or is intended to be occupied by the Qualified Installer.

94.1219.3.2. Seismic gas shut off valves or excess flow shut off valves shall be mounted rigidly to the exterior, or other approved location, of the building or structure containing the fuel gas piping.

	EXCEPTION:&#xA0; If the Department determines that the seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve has been tested and listed for an alternate method of installation, then the seismic gas shut off valve or excess flow shut off valve need not be mounted rigidly to the exterior of the building or structure containing the fuel gas piping.

94.1219.3.3. Seismic gas shut off valves or excess flow shut off valves shall be certified by the Office of the State Architect.

94.1219.3.4. Seismic gas shut off valves or excess flow shut off valves shall be approved by the Department of Building and Safety, Mechanical Testing Laboratory.
