	(Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)

	A.	Evictions.

	1.	The gross amount of payment made into the account by or on behalf of a tenant shall be deemed as a payment in the same amount to the landlord, including, but not limited to, for the purpose of determining whether a tenant has paid rent with respect to Section 151.09 A.1. of this Code or Section 1159 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure.&#xA0; In any action by a landlord to recover possession of a residential unit, the tenant may raise the fact of payments into REAP as an affirmative defense in the same manner as if the payments had been made to and accepted by the landlord.

	2.	While a unit is in REAP, before bringing an action to recover possession on the basis of nonpayment of rent, the landlord shall have a duty to verify in writing with the Department that the tenant has not paid his or her rent to the Department.&#xA0; The Department shall respond within three business days to any request for verification.&#xA0; The landlord shall not bring an action to recover possession on the basis of nonpayment of rent without making this inquiry or if the tenant or the Department presents proof that the tenant has paid the rent demanded to the Department.&#xA0; The violation of this section shall not be a misdemeanor.

	3.	Regardless whether the unit is covered by the RSO, until the unit is removed from REAP and for 180 days thereafter, or until expiration of the period called for under Section 161.806, if applicable, whichever is later, the landlord may bring an action to recover possession of the unit only upon the grounds set forth in Section 151.09 A.

	4.	If the dominant intent of a landlord in seeking to recover possession of a rental unit is retaliation for the tenant&#x2019;s or an Enforcement Agency&#x2019;s exercise of rights or duties under this article, and if the tenant is not in default as to the payment of rent, then the landlord may not recover possession of a rental unit in any action or proceeding or cause the tenant to quit voluntarily.&#xA0; Until the unit is removed from REAP and for one year thereafter, the landlord shall have the burden of proving that any action to recover possession, other than one based on nonpayment of rent, is not brought for the purposes of retaliation.

	5.	In any action by a landlord to recover possession of a rental unit, the tenant may raise as a defense any grounds set forth in this section.&#xA0; If the tenant is the prevailing party, he or she shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys&#x2019; fees and expenses.

	B.	Rent Increases.&#xA0; Until the unit is removed from REAP and for one year thereafter, or until expiration of the period called for under Section 161.807, if applicable, whichever is later, the landlord or any subsequent landlord shall not increase the rent for the current or any subsequent tenants.&#xA0; If the unit is covered by the RSO, after expiration of this period, no rent increase shall be allowed for reimbursement of a capital improvement or cited rehabilitation work for any corrections necessary to comply with the Order that resulted in the placement into REAP or any additional Orders issued while in REAP.

	C.	Civil Actions.&#xA0; Any landlord who violates any of the provisions of this section or who retaliates against a tenant for the tenant&#x2019;s or an Enforcement Agency&#x2019;s exercise of rights or duties under this article shall be liable in a civil action for damages and a penalty of $1,000 per violation, together with reasonable attorneys&#x2019; fees and expenses.&#xA0; Any judgment awarded in such an action may be collected from the escrow account upon application as set forth in Section 162.07 B.</full_text><order_by>09</order_by><ancestry><unit id="112" label="article"><name>Rent Escrow Account Program</name><identifier>2</identifier><url>/16/2/</url></unit><unit id="27" label="chapter"><name>Housing Regulations</name><identifier>16</identifier><url>/16/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="2966"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.00</section_number><catch_line>Title.</catch_line><url>/162.00/</url><token>162.00</token></unit><unit id="1224"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.01</section_number><catch_line>General.</catch_line><url>/162.01/</url><token>162.01</token></unit><unit id="900"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.02</section_number><catch_line>Definitions.</catch_line><url>/162.02/</url><token>162.02</token></unit><unit id="3964"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.03</section_number><catch_line>Referral To Reap.</catch_line><url>/162.03/</url><token>162.03</token></unit><unit id="3207"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.04</section_number><catch_line>Acceptance.</catch_line><url>/162.04/</url><token>162.04</token></unit><unit id="3469"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.05</section_number><catch_line>Rent Reduction Schedule.</catch_line><url>/162.05/</url><token>162.05</token></unit><unit id="789"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.06</section_number><catch_line>Appeals.</catch_line><url>/162.06/</url><token>162.06</token></unit><unit id="3780"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.07</section_number><catch_line>Escrow Account.</catch_line><url>/162.07/</url><token>162.07</token></unit><unit id="756"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.08</section_number><catch_line>Termination Of Reap.</catch_line><url>/162.08/</url><token>162.08</token></unit><unit id="2474"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.09</section_number><catch_line>Tenant Protections.</catch_line><url>/162.09/</url><token>162.09</token></unit><unit id="3965"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.10</section_number><catch_line>Contact With Tenants.</catch_line><url>/162.10/</url><token>162.10</token></unit><unit id="1477"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.11</section_number><catch_line>Recording Of Reap Order And Termination Of Reap.</catch_line><url>/162.11/</url><token>162.11</token></unit><unit id="1975"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.12</section_number><catch_line>Collection Of Reap Fees.</catch_line><url>/162.12/</url><token>162.12</token></unit></structure_contents><next_section id="3965"><structure_id>112</structure_id><section_number>162.10</section_number><catch_line>Contact With Tenants.</catch_line><url>/162.10/</url><token>162.10</token></next_section><metadata></metadata><references></references><url>/162.09/</url><token>162.09</token><formats><txt>/162.09.txt</txt><json>/162.09.xml</json></formats><dublin_core><Title>Tenant Protections.</Title><Type>Text</Type><Format>text/html</Format><Identifier>&#xA7; 162.09</Identifier><Relation>Los Angeles Municipal Code</Relation></dublin_core><plain_text>                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE
