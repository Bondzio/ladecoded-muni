  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
	(Added by Ord. No. 172,782, Eff. 9/30/99.)	The Council of the City of Los
Angeles finds and declares that:	(a)	Structures that are vacant and unsecured or
barricaded attract vagrants, gang members and other criminals as prime locations
to conduct illegal criminal activities.	(b)	Structures that are vacant and not
properly secured are extremely vulnerable to being set on fire by unauthorized
persons.	(c)	Structures that are vacant and unsecured or barricaded are a blight
and cause deterioration and instability in neighborhoods.	(d)	Structures that
are vacant and unsecured or barricaded pose serious threats to the public’s
health and safety and therefore are declared to be public
nuisances.	(e)	Immediate abatement and rehabilitation of these structures is
necessary and can be accomplished by using the judicial or administrative
procedures found in this Code.
