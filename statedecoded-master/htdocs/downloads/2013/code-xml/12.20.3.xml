	(a)	General Requirements

	(1)	Antenna Requirements.&#xA0; The antenna on any monopole or support structure must meet the minimum siting distances to habitable structures required for compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations and standards governing the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.&#xA0; The grouping of WTF on a site is encouraged where technically feasible.&#xA0; The footing of the antenna shall be structurally designed to support a monopole which is at least 15 feet higher than the monopole under review, while being within the applicable requirements of the height district, in order to allow a future wireless network to replace an existing monopole with a new monopole capable of supporting co-location.

	If it is determined that additional height is necessary to support co-location, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to consider reasonable modifications to pole height, and the co-location of additional equipment within the 15 feet extension limit pursuant to Section 12.24W49 of this Code.

	Monopoles, dishes and other antenna equipment not regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall have a non-reflective&#xA0; finish to minimize the visibility of the structure and not be illuminated, unless required by the FAA.

	(2)	Antenna Setback

	(i)	Monopole setback.&#xA0; Monopoles shall be designed at the minimum functional height.&#xA0; All monopoles shall be set back a distance equal to 20 percent of the height of the monopole, from all abutting streets, residential uses, and in all zones, or areas with access to the public, unless a qualified structural engineer specifies in writing that any collapse of the pole will occur within a lesser distance under all foreseeable circumstances.

	The monopole shall be certified by a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of California to meet any structural standards for steel antenna towers and structures set in the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association Standards referenced as EIA/TIA-222-E and as amended.&#xA0; Monopoles shall meet the main building setback requirements of the underlying zone.&#xA0; The setback shall be sufficient to:

	a.	provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as set forth in Subparagraph (5) (Screening) and (6) (Landscaping) of Paragraph (a) of this subsection;

	b.	preserve the privacy of adjoining residential property; and

	c.	protect adjoining property from the potential impact of pole failure.

	(ii)	Attached or Roof Mounted Antenna Setback.&#xA0; Roof mounted antennas shall be located at the greatest feasible distance from the edge of the building.&#xA0; Equipment facilities and antennas shall not extend more than ten feet above the highest point of the roof top, unless mounted on the walls of a penthouse.

	(3)	Locating Antenna at Existing Sites.&#xA0; An effort shall be made to locate new WTF on existing approved structures or sites, when feasible.

	(4)	Visual impact.&#xA0; The WTF shall be designed to have the least possible visual impact on the environment, taking into consideration technical, engineering, economic and other pertinent factors.&#xA0; Antennas clustered at the same site shall be of the same general height and facilities of the same design.

	(5)	Screening

	(i)	Ground, roof and pole mounted antennas shall be screened by fencing, buildings or parapets that appear to be an integral part of the building or landscaping so that not more than 25 percent of the combined tower structure and antenna height is visible from grade level of adjoining property and adjoining public rights-of-way.

	(ii)	Dish antennas shall not be light reflective or have any sign copy on them nor shall they be illuminated, unless required by the FAA.

	(iii)	Building mounted antennas shall be screened from view under most circumstances, if the antennas would otherwise be visible to adjacent properties and adjacent public rights-of-way.

	Omni-directional antennas may not be required to be screened if it is demonstrated that the screening device would create a greater visual impact than the unscreened antennas.

	The screening shall include parapets, walls or similar architectural elements provided that it is painted and textured to integrate with the architecture of the building.

	As an alternative screening method, landscaping positioned on the premises to screen antennas from adjacent properties may be proposed in lieu of, or in combination with, architectural screening.&#xA0; Antennas shall be mounted on the parapet, penthouse wall or facade, building mounted antennas shall be painted and textured or otherwise architecturally integrated to match the existing building.

	(iv)	Support structure antennas shall be placed on premises to minimize visual impacts to adjacent non-industrial properties and adjacent public rights-of-way.&#xA0; Landscaping shall be positioned on the premises to minimize the visual impacts to adjacent non-industrial properties and adjacent public rights-of-way.

	(v)	Accessory equipment and associated equipment facilities shall be located either in an interior space in the existing building or in an attached or detached exterior building.&#xA0; Exterior equipment buildings constructed on premises shall be architecturally similar to the existing building or otherwise architecturally integrated.

	(vi)	Monopoles shall be of tapered design (e.g., three foot base to 1.5 foot top) with no climbing spikes.&#xA0; Whenever possible, existing light standards in parking lots should be used with antennas above electroliers.

	(6)	Landscaping and Maintenance.&#xA0; Landscaping shall be required at the perimeter of the property which abuts streets, residential uses, and in all zones, or areas with access to the public as follows:

	(i)	For monopoles, a landscaped buffer area to soften the visual impact shall commence at the property line.&#xA0; At least one row of shrubs shall be spaced not more than three feet apart.&#xA0; Materials shall be of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting.&#xA0; At least one row of trees or shrubs, not less than four feet in height at the time of planting, and spaced not more than 15 feet apart, also shall be provided.&#xA0; Appropriate irrigation and maintenance to sustain any required landscaping shall be required.

	(ii)	Pursuant to Section 12.24 W.49. of this Code, the decision-maker may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening, including plantings, fences, walls, sign and structural applications, manufactured devices and other features designed to screen, camouflage and buffer antennas, poles and accessory uses.&#xA0; The antenna and supporting structure or monopole shall be of a design and treated with an architectural material so that it is camouflaged to resemble a tree with a single trunk and branches on its upper part, or shall be designed using other similar stealth techniques.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 177,103, Eff. 12/18/05.)

	(7)	Signal Interference.&#xA0; Claims of interference with the operations of any business or residential use due to the operations of the facility shall be subject to correction by the permittee.&#xA0; Any claim shall be reviewed by a qualified, mutually agreeable third party who will test actual site conditions and propose mitigation of any interference determined to be due to the operation of the facility.

	A zoning law which prescribes a minimum area for residential lots is valid and constitutional and is not objectional upon retroactive grounds in destroying the owner&#x2019;s vested property rights, but it looks only to the future in guiding a pattern of home development in the enhancement of the public interest, and a sale of a piece of property which contain less than the minimum area is voidable.
	Clemons v. City of Los Angeles, 36 Cal. 2d 95.

	A sale of property in violation of the ordinance is voidable at the instance of the buyer.
	Harland v. Noto. 105 Cal. App. 2d 740. 743.
	Border v. McClung, 93 Cal. App. 2d 692.

	(b)	No required yard or other open space around an existing building, or which is hereafter provided around any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this article, shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building, nor shall any yard or any other required open space on an adjoining lot be considered as providing a yard or open space on a lot wherein a building is to be erected or established.

	No required yard or other open space around a building shall be located and maintained on property which is in a more restrictive zone than that of the property on which such building is located; except that where a lot is partly in the P zone and partly in a C or M zone, any P zone may be used to meet any yard requirements of the C or M zone, provided the front yard conforms to the requirements of Section 12.21-C,1(g) and all unpaved areas of such yards are suitably landscaped. The relationship between the more restrictive and less restrictive zones shall be determined by the sequence of zones set forth in Section 12.23-B,1(c).&#xA0; (2nd Para., Amended by Ord. No. 151,599, Eff. 11/25/78.)

	(c)	Except in the RZ Zone, every main building shall be located and maintained on a &#x201C;lot&#x201D; or &#x201C;air space lot&#x201D; as defined in this article, and all parts of such building shall be connected in a substantial manner by common walls or a continuous roof. In the RZ Zone a main building may be located on not more than five lots. There may not be more than one such building on a lot in the RA, RE, RS, R1, RU, RMP, or RW1 Zones, or on a group of lots in the RZ Zone. (Amended by Ord. No. 164,904, Eff. 7/6/89.)

	Provided, however, there may be more than one main residential building on a lot in the RW2 Zone, but there shall be no more than one main residential building for each 2,300 square feet of lot area.

	(d)	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,268, Eff. 7/1/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)&#xA0; No building or structure shall be erected or maintained on a lot which abuts a street having only a portion of its required width where no part of the street would normally revert to the lot if vacated, or which lot is separated from the a street by only a future street, unless the yards provided and maintained adjacent to the street in connection with the building or structure have a width or depth, which includes the portion of the lot needed to complete the required width of the street, plus the width or depth of the yards required on the lot by other provisions of this article.&#xA0; Where a future street intervenes between the lot and the street, the yards shall be determined as though the lot abutted directly on the future street.&#xA0; In no case, shall this regulation be applied so as to reduce the buildable width of a corner lot to less than 40 feet.

	The City Planning Commission, upon request, shall determine a required street width.&#xA0; The determination shall be based upon the standards for street widths contained in the subdivision regulations of the City, the prevailing widths of streets in the immediate, surrounding area, with due consideration given to any particular topographical or geological conditions or sizes of ownership affecting the property involved.

	(e)	On any lot of less than one acre in an &#x201C;RA&#x201D; or &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zone which was of record or held in separate ownership on June 1,1946, or was subsequently created either by the recording of a division of land map or otherwise in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations, the originally required front yard shall be provided and maintained on such lot in addition to any new front yard required by any subsequent rearrangement of the lot lines by sale or division (without recording a subdivision map) creating a new lot fronting on a different street than that on which said original lot fronted.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 140,717, Eff. 8/12/70.)

	(f)	No accessory building shall be structurally altered, converted, enlarged or maintained for the purpose of providing living quarters or dwelling units unless such accessory building and all enlargements thereof are made to conform to all the regulations of this article for new buildings.

	(g)	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; Every required front, side and rear yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky, except for those projections permitted by Sections 12.08.5, 12.09.5 and 12.22.

	No automobile parking space shall be provided or maintained within a required front yard. Except where a lot is developed with a building meeting the requirements of Section 12.08.3B1, not more than 50 percent of a required front yard shall be designed, improved or used for access driveways.

	All portions of the required front yard of one-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, multiple dwellings or group dwellings, apartment houses, hotels, motels, apartment hotels and retirement hotels in the RE, RS, R1, RU, RZ, R2, RD, R3, RAS3, R4, RAS4, R5, or C Zones not used for necessary driveways and walkways, including decorative walkways, shall be used for planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.&#xA0; The planted area in the RD, R3, RAS3, R4, RAS4, R5, or C Zones shall be planted in accordance with a landscape plan prepared by a licensed landscape architect, licensed architect, or landscape contractor to the satisfaction of the Department of City Planning.&#xA0; The planted area shall include at least one tree, which shall be at least 15 gallon in size and at least six feet in height at the time of planting, for each 500 square feet of planted area and shall be equipped with an automatic irrigation system, which shall be properly maintained.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 179,191, Eff. 11/5/07.)

	A fee pursuant to Section 19.01I shall be paid to the Department of City Planning for the checking of landscape plans, pursuant to this paragraph. However, the fee shall be waived if any other fee has been paid for checking of landscape plans for the same property.

	No swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water which is designed or used to contain water 18 inches or more in depth shall be permitted in any required yard space in which fences over 3-1/2 feet in height are prohibited, even though the pool, pond or body of water extends below the adjacent natural ground level.

	(h)	At each end of a through lot there shall be a front yard of the depth required by this article for the zone in which each street frontage is located, except that only one front yard need be provided on those through lots which abut on a primary, major or secondary highway, as such highways are shown on the &#x201C;Highways and Freeways Element of the General Plan,&#x201D; when the rights to vehicular ingress and egress from such through lots to the highway have been abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction as a condition precedent to the approval of the recordation of the subdivision in which such through lots are included. Where only one front yard is required on a through lot, as provided herein, the rear yard shall be located on the portion of such lot adjacent to the highway.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 141,821, Eff. 5/24/71.)

	Where a through lot is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single building site, and the two required front yards are provided, no rear yard is required.

	(i)	No required yard or other open space around an existing building shall be separated in ownership from the portion of the lot upon which the building is located.

	(j)	The area of a lot upon which a building or use is located shall not be reduced below the total area required for all of the dwelling units or guest rooms contained in the building or required for the specific use, or required because of the height or total floor area contained in the building, by separating the ownership of a portion of the lot from that upon which the building or use is located. No required lot which is provided for a dwelling unit, guest room, specific use or total floor area within a building shall be considered as providing the required lot area for any other dwelling unit, guest room, specific use or total floor area within a building. (Amended by Ord. No. 110,225, Eff. 11/23/57.)

	(k)	No lot or parcel of land held under separate ownership at the time this article becomes effective shall be separated in ownership or reduced in size below the minimum lot width or lot area required by this article, nor shall any lot or parcel of land held under separate ownership at the time this article becomes effective and which has a width or an area less than that required by this article be further reduced in any manner.

	(l)	In determining the required side and rear yards of a building, any basement containing habitable rooms shall be considered a story. (Added by Ord. No. 131,309, Eff. 4/24/66,)

	See citation under Sec. 12.21-C,l, (a)

	2.	Spaces Between Buildings &#x2013; Passageways. &#x2013; When more than one residential building or a rear residential building is located on a lot or the entrance to a residential building is not directly from a street, the following passageways and other open spaces shall be provided and maintained.

	(a)	(Amended by Ord. No. 151,608, Eff. 11/26/78.)&#xA0; There shall be at least 20 feet of space between every two-story apartment hotel, apartment house, boarding or rooming house, guest house hotel or multiple dwelling, and any other main building on the same lot. Such space may be reduced to 10 feet where the buildings are located on a corner lot and the space opens directly onto the side street.

	In the RD zone there shall be at least 20 feet of space between every main building and any other main building on the same lot where either of the buildings contains three or more dwelling units.

	In all other cases there shall be at least 10 feet of space between every residential building and another main building on the same lot.

	The width of the space herein required shall be increased by two feet for each story over two contained in any building adjoining said space.

	Those regulations do not apply to the spaces required between accessory buildings (not designed as residential buildings) and other buildings on the same lot as otherwise provided for in Subdivision 5 of this subsection.

	(b)	There shall be a passageway of at least 10 feet in width extending from a street to one entrance of each dwelling unit or guest room in every residential building, except those located in the RW, RU, or RZ Zones, unless there is an entrance to the dwelling unit or guest room opening directly onto a public street or into a hallway opening into a public street or onto a l0-foot passageway extending to a public street. In the RW and RZ Zones, there shall be a passageway at least 4 feet in width, and in the RU Zone, there shall be a passageway at least 3 feet in width, extending from a street, or public right-of-way in the case of the RW Zones, to one entrance of each dwelling unit in every residential building. (Amended by Ord. No. 161,716, Eff. 12/6/86.)

	The passageway shall be increased by two feet in width for each story over two contained in any building located between the public street and the building which the passageway serves. The passageway shall be located on the same lot as the building which it serves.

	Where a one story, one or two-family dwelling has been continuously maintained on the front of a lot since prior to June 1,1946, with a passageway of less than ten feet but not less than eight feet in width from the street to the rear of said dwelling, an additional one or two family dwelling may be erected and maintained on the rear of the lot, provided the passageway is not further reduced. However, this limited passageway shall be permitted where there are to be only two residential buildings on the lot. (Amended by Ord. No. 108,661, Eff. 2/11/57.)

	In addition to all other applicable provisions herein, where a building or portion thereof is constructed on or within an air space lot, and such building or portion thereof is used for residential purposes, there shall be a passageway extending from a street to the entrance of such building on the lot which has had the air space above or below it divided by such air space lot or lots. (4th Para. Added by Ord. No. 156,681, Eff. 6/21/82.)

	(c)	In computing the width of a passageway where the passageway, adjoins a lot line, the width of any required yard adjoining such lot line may be assumed to be a portion of the required width of the passageway.

	(d)	Any space between buildings or any passageway having less width than that required by this subdivision shall be maintained and shall not be further reduced in any manner.

	(e)	The passageways and other open spaces required by this subdivision shall be open and unobstructed from ground to sky, except for the projections permitted by the provisions of Section 12.22 C., and except that Solar Structures that provide shade over the habitable area may cover up to 25% of the required open space.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,110, Eff. 5/29/12.)

	(b)	For churches, clubs, educational institutions, elementary and high schools, libraries or museums, the combined widths of the two side yards on an interior lot shall be not less than 40% of the width of the lot, but need not exceed 50 feet, and on either an interior lot or a corner lot the side yard adjoining another lot in an &#x201C;RA&#x201D; or &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zone shall be not less than ten feet in width.

	(c)	The side or rear yard required for the buildings referred to in (a) and (b) hereof, which adjoin property in a &#x201C;C&#x201D;, &#x201C;CM&#x201D; or &#x201C;M&#x201D; Zone, or the side yard which adjoins the street side of a corner lot, may be the same as required for buildings in the &#x201C;R4&#x201D; Zone. (Sec. 12.11 C.2. and 3.);

	(d)	All other yards in connection with buildings referred to in (a) and (b) hereof, shall comply with the regulations on the zone in which the building is located.

	(e)	For hospitals, institutions, churches, libraries, museums or other similar uses located in a building which combines residential and commercial uses pursuant to Section 12.22 A.18. (developments combining residential and commercial uses), the yard requirements set forth in Section 12.22 A.18.(c) shall apply. (Added by Ord. No. 156,681, Eff. 6/21/82.)

Notwithstanding the required yards, or setbacks, outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-1 above, or those exceptions found in Section 12.22 of this Code, the following provisions shall apply:

	(1)	Prevailing Front Yard Setbacks.

	(i)	Where there are two or more developed Lots which have Front Yards that vary in depth by not more than 10 feet, and such Lots comprise 40% or more of the Frontage, then the minimum Front Yard depth shall be the average depth of the Front Yards of such Lots.

	(ii)	Where there are two or more possible combinations of developed Lots comprising 40% or more of the Frontage, and these Lots have Front Yards that vary in depth by not more than 10 feet, then the minimum Front Yard depth shall be the average depth of the Front Yards of that combination which has the shallowest average depth.

	(iii)	In determining the required Front Yard, the following shall not be taken into account:&#xA0; Buildings located on key Lots, entirely on the rear half of Lots, or on Lots in the &#x201C;C&#x201D; or &#x201C;M&#x201D; Zones.

	(iv)	Nothing contained in this subparagraph (1) shall, however, be deemed to require Front Yards which exceed 40 feet in depth.

	(2)	Front Yard Setback on Lots Fronting on Substandard Hillside Limited Street.&#xA0; For any Lot that fronts on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, there shall be a minimum Front Yard setback of at least five feet.&#xA0; However, the prevailing Front Yard setback regulations, as outlined in Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a), shall apply, so long as a Front Yard setback of no less than five feet is provided.

	(3)	Front Yard Setbacks on Key Lots.&#xA0; On Key Lots, the minimum Front Yard may be the average of the required Front Yard for the adjoining Interior Lot and the required Side Yard along the Street side of a Reversed Corner Lot.&#xA0; But such minimum Front Yard may apply for a distance of not more than 85 feet from the rear Lot line of the Reversed Corner Lot, beyond which point the Front Yard specified in Table 12.21 C.10-1 or Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a) shall apply.&#xA0; Where existing Buildings on either or both of said adjoining Lots are located nearer to the front or side Lot lines than the Yard required by this Paragraph (a), the Yards established by such existing buildings may be used in computing the required Front Yard for a Key Lot.

	(4)	Front Yard Setbacks on Through Lots.&#xA0; At each end of a Through Lot, there shall be a Front Yard setback as required by this Paragraph (a) for the zone in which each Street Frontage is located.&#xA0; But only one Front Yard need be provided on those Through Lots which abut on a primary, Major or Secondary Highway, as such highways are shown on the &#x201C;Highways and Freeways Element of the General Plan&#x201D;, when the rights to vehicular ingress and egress from such Through Lots to the highways have been abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction.&#xA0; Where only one Front Yard is required on a Through Lot, as provided herein, the Rear Yard shall be located on the portion of such Lot adjacent to the highway.

	Where a Through Lot is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single Building site, and the two required Front Yards are provided, no Rear Yard is required.

	(5)	Front Yard Paving.&#xA0; All portions of the required Front Yard not used for necessary driveways and walkways, including decorative walkways, shall be used for planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.

	(6)	Front Yard on Lots Existing Prior to June 1, 1946.&#xA0; This provision shall apply to any Lot of less than one acre which was of record or held in separate ownership on June 1, 1946, or was subsequently created either by the recording of a division of land map or otherwise in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations.&#xA0; On any such Lot, the originally required Front Yard shall be provided and maintained in addition to any new Front Yard required by any subsequent rearrangement of the Lot lines by sale or division (without recording a subdivision map) creating a new Lot fronting on a different Street than that on which the original Lot fronted.

	(7)	Side and Rear Yards for Basements.&#xA0; In determining the required Side and Rear Yards of a Building, any Basement containing Habitable Rooms shall be considered a Story.

	(8)	Yards in the Coastal Zone.&#xA0; The following setback requirements shall apply to Lots located in a Coastal Zone:

	(i)	On a Lot in the RE9 or RE11 Zone, there shall be a Side Yard on each side of a main Building of not less than 5 feet.&#xA0; Where the Lot is less than 50 feet in width, the Side Yard may be reduced to 10% of the width of the Lot, but in no event less than 3 feet.

	(ii)	In lieu of the additional Side Yard requirement in Table 12.21 C.10-1, for a Building more than two-stories in height on Lots in the R1, RS, or RE Zone, one foot shall be added to the width of each required Side Yard for each additional Story above the second Story.

	(iii)	On a Lot in the RA Zone, where a Side Yard is less than 10 feet in width, and the Building erected on the Lot is three or more Stories in height, one foot shall be added to such Side Yard.

	(9)	Side Yards in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in Subdivision Approvals.&#xA0; Side Yard requirements in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in subdivision approvals shall take precedence over requirements of this Subdivision 10.&#xA0; Otherwise, this Subdivision shall apply.

	(10)	Encroachments Into Required Yards.&#xA0; Every required Front, Side and Rear Yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for the following:

	(i)	Garages in Front Yards.&#xA0; A Private Garage may be located on the required Front Yard of a Lot where the Elevation of the ground at a point 50 feet from the front Lot line of a Lot and midway between the side Lot lines differs 10 feet or more from the curb level, provided every portion of the garage Building is at least 5 feet from the front Lot line.&#xA0; Where the wall of such garage is two-thirds below natural or finished Grade of the Lot, whichever is lower, said wall may extend to the adjacent side Lot line; in all other cases, said garage shall not be nearer to the side Lot line than the width of the Side Yard required for a main Building of the same height.

	(ii)	Open, Unenclosed Stairways, Porches, Platforms, Landing Places, or Balconies.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, on Lots fronting onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, open unenclosed stairways, porches, platforms and landing places not covered by a roof or canopy shall not project or extend into the Front Yard.&#xA0; Balconies with 10 feet or more of vertical clearance beneath them may project or extend no more than 30 inches into a Front Yard.

	(iii)	Other Exceptions.&#xA0; All of those exceptions found in Subdivision 5. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 and in Section 12.22 of this Code.

	(11)	Pools, Ponds, or Body of Water in Required Yards.&#xA0; No swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water which is designed or used to contain water 18 inches or more in depth shall be permitted in any required Yard Space in which fences over 42 inches in height are prohibited, even though the pool, pond or body of water extends below the adjacent natural ground level.

	(12)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.&#xA0; For Lots fronting on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, a Zoning Administrator may grant a reduction of the front Setback requirements of Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph and Side Yard requirements in Table 12.21 C.10-1, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code; however, in no event shall the Side Yard be less than 4 feet.

	(b)	Maximum Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; The maximum Residential Floor Area contained in all Buildings and Accessory Buildings shall not exceed the sum of the square footage of each Slope Band multiplied by the corresponding Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for the zone of the Lot, as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-2a.&#xA0; This formula can be found in Table 12.21 C.10-2b, where &#x201C;A&#x201D; is the area of the Lot within each Slope Band, &#x201C;FAR&#x201D; is the FAR of the corresponding Slope Band, and &#x201C;RFA&#x201D; is the sum of the Residential Floor Area of each Slope Band.

	The guaranteed minimum for the original zone as stated in the paragraph above shall apply to Lots that meet the following criteria:&#xA0; have an area that is less than 50% of the minimum Lot size for its Zone, were made nonconforming in Lot size as a result of an adopted zone change or code amendment changing the minimum Lot size, and met the minimum Lot size requirements of the original zone.

	(3)	Residential Floor Area Bonus.&#xA0; An additional 20% of the maximum Residential Floor Area as determined by Table 12.21 C.10-2 of this Paragraph (b), or an additional 30% for Lots where the guaranteed minimum outlined in Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph (b) is utilized, for that Lot shall be allowed if any of the options listed below is utilized.&#xA0; Only one bonus per property is allowed.

	(i)	Proportional Stories Option.&#xA0; The total Residential Floor Area of each Story other than the Base Floor in a multi-Story Building does not exceed 75% of the Base Floor Area. This option shall only apply to flat Building pads where the Slope of the Building pad area prior to any Grading, as measured from the highest and lowest Elevation points of the existing Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of the proposed Building or Structure, is less than 15%; or

	(ii)	Front Facade Stepback Option.&#xA0; The cumulative length of the exterior walls which are not a part of a garage facing the Front Lot Line, equal to a minimum of 25% of the Building width, shall be stepped-back a distance of at least 20% of the Building depth from a plane parallel to the Lot width established at the point of the Building closest to the Front Lot line.&#xA0; When the Front Lot line is not straight, a line connecting the points where the Side Lot lines and the Front Lot line intersect shall be used to establish the plane parallel to the front Lot width.&#xA0; When Through Lots have, or are required to provide, two Front Yard setbacks, the step-back shall be provided along both Front Lot Lines.&#xA0; When referred by the Department of Building and Safety, for unusual Building and/or Lot configuration, the Director of Planning or his/her designee shall determine that the proposed project complies with this provision and qualifies for a Residential Floor Area bonus.

	For the purposes of this provision, all exterior walls that intersect a plane parallel to the Front Lot Line at 45 degrees or less shall be considered to be facing the Front Lot Line.&#xA0; The Building width shall be the greatest distance between the exterior walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot width.&#xA0; The Building depth shall be the greatest distance between the exterior walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot depth.

	This option shall only apply to Structures which are no more than 35 feet from the Frontage along an improved Street and on a &#x201C;flat&#x201D; Building pad where the Slope of the Building pad prior to any Grading, as measured from the highest point of the existing Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior wall of the proposed Building or Structure to the lowest point of the existing natural Grade within 5 horizontal feet, is less than 15%; or

	(iii)	Cumulative Side Yard Setbacks Option.&#xA0; The combined width of Side Yards shall be at least 25% of the total Lot Width, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, but in no event shall a single Side Yard setback be less than 10% of the Lot Width or the minimum required by Paragraph (a) of this Subdivision, whichever is greater.&#xA0; One foot shall be added to each required Side Yard for each increment of 10 feet or fraction thereof of height above the first 18 feet of height.&#xA0; The width of a required Side Yard setback shall be maintained for the entire length of a Side Yard and cannot alternate from one Side Yard to the other; or

	(iv)	18-Foot Envelope Height Option.&#xA0; For properties which are not in the &#x201C;1SS&#x201D; Single-Story Height District, the maximum envelope height, measured pursuant to Subparagraph (1) of Paragraph (d) of this Subdivision 10., shall be no more than 18 feet; or&#xA0;

	(v)	Multiple Structures Option.&#xA0; In addition to the Lot coverage requirements in Paragraph (e) of this Subdivision, any one Building and Structure extending more than 6 feet above Hillside Area Grade, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, shall cover no more than 20% of the area of a Lot.&#xA0; Such Buildings or Structures may only be connected by one breezeway, fully enclosed walkway, elevator, or combination thereof of not more than 5 feet in width; or

	(vi)	Minimal Grading Option.&#xA0; For properties where at least 60% of the Lot is comprised of Slopes which are 30% or greater, as determined by a Slope Analysis Map prepared in accordance with Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (b), the total amount of any Grading on the site (including exempted Grading, as outlined in Paragraph (f) of this Subdivision (10)) does not exceed the numeric value of 10% of the total Lot size in cubic yards or 1,000 cubic yards, whichever is less (example:&#xA0; a project involving 500 cubic-yards of Grading on a 5,000 square-foot Lot will be eligible for this bonus option); or

	(vii)	Green Building Option.&#xA0; For a new One-Family Dwelling only, the new construction must satisfy the Tier 1 requirements or higher of the LA Green Building Code, as defined in Section 99.01.101.1 of this Code.

	(4)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.

	(i)	10% Adjustments.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator has the authority to grant adjustments from the requirements of this Paragraph (b) of not more than 10%, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subsection A. of Section 12.28 of this Code.

	(ii)	Additions to Structures Existing Prior to August 1, 2010.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator has the authority to approve any additions made after August 1, 2010,&#xA0; to a One-Family Dwelling existing prior to that date for which permits have been previously obtained which exceed the requirements of this Paragraph (b), pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code, provided:

	a.	the total cumulative Residential Floor Area of all such additions does not exceed 1,000 square feet; and&#xA0;

	b.	the resulting Building does not exceed the height of the original Building or the height permitted in Paragraph (d) of this Subdivision 10. below, whichever is greater; and&#xA0;

	c.	at least two off-street covered parking spaces are provided.

	(c)	Verification of Existing Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; For additions with cumulative Residential Floor Area of less than 1,000 square feet constructed after August 1, 2010, or remodels of Buildings built prior to August 1, 2010, the existing Residential Floor Area shall be the same as the Building square footage shown on the most recent Los Angeles County Tax Assessor&#x2019;s records at the time the plans are submitted to the Department of Building and Safety and a plan check fee is paid.&#xA0; Except that Residential Floor Area may be calculated as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code when a complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area calculations of all the Structures on the Lot, prepared by a licensed architect or engineer, is submitted by the applicant.

	Any work that does not qualify as a remodel, as defined in the paragraph below, or additions that are 1,000 square feet or larger shall require a complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area calculations of all the Structures on the Lot prepared by a licensed architect or engineer.

	For the purposes of implementing this Paragraph (c), a remodel shall mean the alteration of an existing Building or Structure provided that at least 50 percent of the perimeter length of the contiguous exterior walls and 50 percent of the roof are retained.

	(d)	Height Limits.&#xA0; No portion of a Building or Structure shall be erected or enlarged which exceeds the envelope height limits as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-4, or as otherwise stated in the paragraphs below.&#xA0; For the provisions below, whenever Grade is mentioned, it shall mean Hillside Area Grade as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code.

	(1)	Measurement of Height.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code, the height limits in Table 12.21 C.10-4 shall be measured as set forth below.

	(i)	Maximum Envelope Height.&#xA0; Envelope height (otherwise known as vertical height or &#x201C;plumb line&#x201D; height) shall be the vertical distance from the Grade of the site to a projected plane at the roof Structure or parapet wall located directly above and parallel to the Grade.&#xA0; Measurement of the envelope height shall originate at the lowest Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of a Building or Structure.&#xA0; At no point shall any given section of any part of the proposed Building or Structure exceed the maximum envelope height.

	A topographic map shall be submitted as a separate plan sheet or as part of the site plan identifying the 5-foot perimeter of the exterior walls, or any other information which the Department of Building and Safety deems necessary to determine compliance with this Paragraph (i).

	(2)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may allow Structures which exceed the maximum envelope height requirements of Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (d); however, the increase in height may not result in a Building or Structure which exceeds an overall height of 45 feet, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code.&#xA0; The overall height shall be measured from the lowest Elevation point within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of a Building or Structure to the highest Elevation point of the roof Structure or parapet wall.

	(3)	Prevailing Height.&#xA0; Notwithstanding Table 12.21 C.10-4 of this Paragraph (d), when 40% or more of the existing One-Family Dwellings with Frontage on both sides of the block have Building heights exceeding these limits, the maximum envelope height for any Building on that block may be the average height of the Dwellings exceeding these limits.

	(4)	Lots in a Single-Story Height District.&#xA0; As enabled by Section 12.21.1 A.1. of this Code, on Lots in a &#x201C;SS&#x201D; Single Story Height District, shown as &#x201C;1SS&#x201D; on a Zoning Map, no Building or Structure shall be erected or enlarged which exceeds one Story.

	Notwithstanding the provision in Section 12.21.1 A.8., in determining the number of Stories, any Basement which is exempt from the Residential Floor Area calculation, as outlined in Section 12.03 of this Code, shall not be considered a Story.

	(5)	Lots Fronting on Substandard Hillside Limited Streets.&#xA0; For any Lot fronting onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, as defined in Section 12.03, and subject to the 5-foot Front Yard setback, no portion of a Building or Structure within 20 feet of the Front Lot Line shall exceed 24 feet in height.&#xA0; The 24 foot maximum Building and Structure height shall be measured from the Elevation at the centerline or midpoint of the Street on which the Lot fronts.

	(6)	Unenclosed/Uncovered Rooftop Decks and Cantilevered Balconies.&#xA0; Unenclosed/uncovered rooftop decks, cantilevered balconies and &#x201C;visually permeable railing&#x201D; (no more than 42 inches in height), may project beyond the maximum envelope height, as limited and measured in Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (d), no more than 5 horizontal feet.

	For the purposes of this Subparagraph (6), &#x201C;visually permeable railing&#x201D; means railing constructed of material that is transparent, such as glass or plastic panels, or wrought iron or other solid material which is 80% open to light and air.

	(7)	Roof Structures.&#xA0; Roof Structures as described in Table 12.21 C.10-5 below, or similar Structures, may be erected above the height limit specified in Table 12.21 C.10-4.

	No roof Structure or any other space above the height limit specified in Table 12.21 C.10-4 shall be allowed for the purpose of providing additional floor space.

	(8)	Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or Subdivision Approvals.&#xA0; Height limitations in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in subdivision approvals shall take precedence over the requirements of this Section 12.21.&#xA0; Otherwise, this Section 12.21 shall apply.

	(e)	Lot Coverage.&#xA0; Buildings and Structures extending more than 6 feet above natural ground level shall cover no more than 40% of the area of a Lot.

	(1)	Lot Coverage on Substandard Lots.&#xA0; Notwithstanding Paragraph (e) above, for a Lot which is substandard as to width (less than 50 feet) and as to area (less than 5,000 square feet), Buildings and Structures shall cover no more than 45% of the area of a Lot.

	(2)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may grant limited deviations from these requirements, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code.

	(f)	Grading.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, total Grading (Cut and Fill) on a Lot shall be limited as outlined below.&#xA0; No Grading permits shall be issued until a Building permit is approved.

	(1)	Maximum Grading Quantities.&#xA0; The cumulative quantity of Grading, or the total combined value of both Cut and Fill or incremental Cut and Fill, for any one property shall be limited to a base maximum of 500 cubic yards plus the numeric value equal to 5% of the total Lot size in cubic yards.&#xA0; Example: a 5,000 square-foot Lot would have a maximum Grading amount of 750 cubic yards (500 cubic yards for the base amount + 250 cubic yards for the 5% calculation). &#xA0;

	However, the cumulative quantity of Grading shall not exceed the maximum &#x201C;by-right&#x201D; Grading quantities outlined by Zone in Table 12.21 C.10-6 below.

of dwelling units or guest rooms obtainable from any such arrangement. (Amended
by Ord. No. 149,118, Eff. 2/5/77.)	2.	Other Use and Yard Determinations by the
Zoning Administrator.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 177,103, Eff. 12/18/05.)&#xA0; The&#xA0;
Zoning Administrator shall have authority to determine other uses, in addition

automobile parking spaces required shall be the sum of the requirements of the
various uses, except as provided below.	(2)	If there is office space auxiliary
to a manufacturing, warehouse, or other industrial use on the same lot, the
office use shall have its required parking spaces computed at the same ratio as
the industrial use. However, if the office space exceeds 10 percent of the total

maintenance of more automobile parking space than is required herein for a new
building or structure identical to said existing building or structure, nor the
maintenance of such space for any type of main building or structure other than
those specified herein.&#xA0; Further, provided, however, that if a building or
structure constructed after the effective date of this ordinance is of
insufficient floor area at the time of its construction to be required to
provide parking spaces by the requirements of this section, but is subsequently
increased in floor area in such a manner that it would be subject to said
requirements, parking spaces shall then be provided on the basis of the total
resulting floor area.	Exceptions:	(1)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this section to the contrary and for any existing high rise building cited under
Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 91.8604.6.3, the Department of Building and

lots, or is located adjacent to land used or being acquired for publicly owned
parking lots.&#xA0; The City Planning Commission, with the assistance of the

waived parking spaces exceed the total number provided on the publicly owned
parking lots.	(p)	Exception for Central City Area.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 129,334,
Eff. 2/28/65.) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the

or more major or secondary highways from which there are routes to a subdivision
site, signs may be approved only along two routes.	(5)	The erection and
maintenance of temporary, unlighted, subdivision directional signs may be
approved only on vacant property; however, if a Zoning Administrator determines

directions are essential, he or she may approve developed property for the
location of signs.	(6)	Signs may not be located within the public right-of-way
of any highway, street, alley, or on any other public right-of-way.	(7)	All
signs permitted by this paragraph shall be removed within five days after the

sign shall be subject to approval by a Zoning Administrator.	(9)	The approval of
temporary subdivision directional signs pursuant to these regulations does not
release the applicant from the responsibilities of complying with any provisions
of the Los Angeles Municipal Code pertaining to building permit requirements or
any other provisions of the Code regulating signs.	(10)	Appeals.&#xA0; Appeals from
a determination by a Zoning Administrator may be taken to the Area Planning

174,132, Eff. 9/3/01.)&#xA0; Wireless Telecommunication Facilities (WTF) Standards
&#x2013; Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary, the following
standards shall apply to the placement of all wireless telecommunication
facilities.&#xA0; These standards shall not apply to satellite dish antennae, radio
and television transmitters and antennae incidental to residential
use.	(a)	General Requirements	(1)	Antenna Requirements.&#xA0; The antenna on any
monopole or support structure must meet the minimum siting distances to
habitable structures required for compliance with Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulations and standards governing the environmental effects
of radio frequency emissions.&#xA0; The grouping of WTF on a site is encouraged
where technically feasible.&#xA0; The footing of the antenna shall be structurally
designed to support a monopole which is at least 15 feet higher than the
monopole under review, while being within the applicable requirements of the
height district, in order to allow a future wireless network to replace an
existing monopole with a new monopole capable of supporting co-location.	If it
is determined that additional height is necessary to support co-location, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to consider reasonable modifications to pole
height, and the co-location of additional equipment within the 15 feet extension
limit pursuant to Section 12.24W49 of this Code.	Monopoles, dishes and other
antenna equipment not regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
shall have a non-reflective&#xA0; finish to minimize the visibility of the structure
and not be illuminated, unless required by the FAA.	(2)	Antenna
Setback	(i)	Monopole setback.&#xA0; Monopoles shall be designed at the minimum
functional height.&#xA0; All monopoles shall be set back a distance equal to 20
percent of the height of the monopole, from all abutting streets, residential
uses, and in all zones, or areas with access to the public, unless a qualified
structural engineer specifies in writing that any collapse of the pole will
occur within a lesser distance under all foreseeable circumstances.	The monopole
shall be certified by a professional structural engineer licensed in the State
of California to meet any structural standards for steel antenna towers and
structures set in the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications
Industries Association Standards referenced as EIA/TIA-222-E and as amended.&#xA0;
Monopoles shall meet the main building setback requirements of the underlying
zone.&#xA0; The setback shall be sufficient to:	a.	provide for an adequate
vegetative, topographic or other buffer as set forth in Subparagraph (5)
(Screening) and (6) (Landscaping) of Paragraph (a) of this
subsection;	b.	preserve the privacy of adjoining residential property;
and	c.	protect adjoining property from the potential impact of pole
failure.	(ii)	Attached or Roof Mounted Antenna Setback.&#xA0; Roof mounted antennas
shall be located at the greatest feasible distance from the edge of the
building.&#xA0; Equipment facilities and antennas shall not extend more than ten
feet above the highest point of the roof top, unless mounted on the walls of a
penthouse.	(3)	Locating Antenna at Existing Sites.&#xA0; An effort shall be made to
locate new WTF on existing approved structures or sites, when
feasible.	(4)	Visual impact.&#xA0; The WTF shall be designed to have the least
possible visual impact on the environment, taking into consideration technical,
engineering, economic and other pertinent factors.&#xA0; Antennas clustered at the
same site shall be of the same general height and facilities of the same
design.	(5)	Screening	(i)	Ground, roof and pole mounted antennas shall be
screened by fencing, buildings or parapets that appear to be an integral part of
the building or landscaping so that not more than 25 percent of the combined
tower structure and antenna height is visible from grade level of adjoining
property and adjoining public rights-of-way.	(ii)	Dish antennas shall not be
light reflective or have any sign copy on them nor shall they be illuminated,
unless required by the FAA.	(iii)	Building mounted antennas shall be screened
from view under most circumstances, if the antennas would otherwise be visible
to adjacent properties and adjacent public rights-of-way.	Omni-directional
antennas may not be required to be screened if it is demonstrated that the
screening device would create a greater visual impact than the unscreened
antennas.	The screening shall include parapets, walls or similar architectural
elements provided that it is painted and textured to integrate with the
architecture of the building.	As an alternative screening method, landscaping
positioned on the premises to screen antennas from adjacent properties may be
proposed in lieu of, or in combination with, architectural screening.&#xA0; Antennas
shall be mounted on the parapet, penthouse wall or facade, building mounted
antennas shall be painted and textured or otherwise architecturally integrated
to match the existing building.	(iv)	Support structure antennas shall be placed
on premises to minimize visual impacts to adjacent non-industrial properties and
adjacent public rights-of-way.&#xA0; Landscaping shall be positioned on the premises
to minimize the visual impacts to adjacent non-industrial properties and
adjacent public rights-of-way.	(v)	Accessory equipment and associated equipment
facilities shall be located either in an interior space in the existing building
or in an attached or detached exterior building.&#xA0; Exterior equipment buildings
constructed on premises shall be architecturally similar to the existing
building or otherwise architecturally integrated.	(vi)	Monopoles shall be of
tapered design (e.g., three foot base to 1.5 foot top) with no climbing
spikes.&#xA0; Whenever possible, existing light standards in parking lots should be
used with antennas above electroliers.	(6)	Landscaping and Maintenance.&#xA0;
Landscaping shall be required at the perimeter of the property which abuts
streets, residential uses, and in all zones, or areas with access to the public
as follows:	(i)	For monopoles, a landscaped buffer area to soften the visual
impact shall commence at the property line.&#xA0; At least one row of shrubs shall
be spaced not more than three feet apart.&#xA0; Materials shall be of a variety
which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in
height within two years of planting.&#xA0; At least one row of trees or shrubs, not
less than four feet in height at the time of planting, and spaced not more than
15 feet apart, also shall be provided.&#xA0; Appropriate irrigation and maintenance
to sustain any required landscaping shall be required.	(ii)	Pursuant to Section
12.24 W.49. of this Code, the decision-maker may allow use of an alternate
detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening, including
plantings, fences, walls, sign and structural applications, manufactured devices
and other features designed to screen, camouflage and buffer antennas, poles and
accessory uses.&#xA0; The antenna and supporting structure or monopole shall be of a
design and treated with an architectural material so that it is camouflaged to
resemble a tree with a single trunk and branches on its upper part, or shall be
designed using other similar stealth techniques.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 177,103,
Eff. 12/18/05.)	(7)	Signal Interference.&#xA0; Claims of interference with the
operations of any business or residential use due to the operations of the
facility shall be subject to correction by the permittee.&#xA0; Any claim shall be
reviewed by a qualified, mutually agreeable third party who will test actual
site conditions and propose mitigation of any interference determined to be due
to the operation of the facility.	(8)	Time Limits.&#xA0; All wireless
telecommunication facilities shall be removed within 90 days of discontinuance
of use.	(b)	Application Requirements Checklist For Discretionary Actions. &#xA0; In

Port of Los Angeles Community Plan Area.	(a)	The following provisions apply to
the stacking of cargo containers:	(1)	The stacking of cargo containers more than
20 feet high shall only be permitted if a structural analysis done by a licensed
engineer or architect in the State of California is submitted to and approved by
the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS).	(2)	Cargo container
stacking within 300 feet or less of a residential zone shall be limited to a

Sec. 12.22- C)	(a)	No building or structure shall be erected or maintained and
no existing building shall be enlarged, moved or maintained unless all the area
regulations are complied with for the zone in which they are located.	A zoning
law which prescribes a minimum area for residential lots is valid and
constitutional and is not objectional upon retroactive grounds in destroying the
owner&#x2019;s vested property rights, but it looks only to the future in guiding a
pattern of home development in the enhancement of the public interest, and a
sale of a piece of property which contain less than the minimum area is
voidable.
	Clemons v. City of Los Angeles, 36 Cal. 2d 95.	A sale of property in violation
of the ordinance is voidable at the instance of the buyer.
	Harland v. Noto. 105 Cal. App. 2d 740. 743.
	Border v. McClung, 93 Cal. App. 2d 692.	(b)	No required yard or other open
space around an existing building, or which is hereafter provided around any
building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this article, shall
be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building, nor
shall any yard or any other required open space on an adjoining lot be
considered as providing a yard or open space on a lot wherein a building is to
be erected or established.	No required yard or other open space around a
building shall be located and maintained on property which is in a more
restrictive zone than that of the property on which such building is located;
except that where a lot is partly in the P zone and partly in a C or M zone, any
P zone may be used to meet any yard requirements of the C or M zone, provided
the front yard conforms to the requirements of Section 12.21-C,1(g) and all
unpaved areas of such yards are suitably landscaped. The relationship between
the more restrictive and less restrictive zones shall be determined by the
sequence of zones set forth in Section 12.23-B,1(c).&#xA0; (2nd Para., Amended by
Ord. No. 151,599, Eff. 11/25/78.)	(c)	Except in the RZ Zone, every main building
shall be located and maintained on a &#x201C;lot&#x201D; or &#x201C;air space lot&#x201D; as defined
in this article, and all parts of such building shall be connected in a
substantial manner by common walls or a continuous roof. In the RZ Zone a main
building may be located on not more than five lots. There may not be more than
one such building on a lot in the RA, RE, RS, R1, RU, RMP, or RW1 Zones, or on a
group of lots in the RZ Zone. (Amended by Ord. No. 164,904, Eff.
7/6/89.)	Provided, however, there may be more than one main residential building
on a lot in the RW2 Zone, but there shall be no more than one main residential
building for each 2,300 square feet of lot area.	(d)	(Amended by Ord. No.
173,268, Eff. 7/1/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)&#xA0; No building or structure shall be erected
or maintained on a lot which abuts a street having only a portion of its
required width where no part of the street would normally revert to the lot if
vacated, or which lot is separated from the a street by only a future street,
unless the yards provided and maintained adjacent to the street in connection
with the building or structure have a width or depth, which includes the portion
of the lot needed to complete the required width of the street, plus the width
or depth of the yards required on the lot by other provisions of this article.&#xA0;
Where a future street intervenes between the lot and the street, the yards shall
be determined as though the lot abutted directly on the future street.&#xA0; In no
case, shall this regulation be applied so as to reduce the buildable width of a
corner lot to less than 40 feet.	The City Planning Commission, upon request,
shall determine a required street width.&#xA0; The determination shall be based upon
the standards for street widths contained in the subdivision regulations of the
City, the prevailing widths of streets in the immediate, surrounding area, with
due consideration given to any particular topographical or geological conditions
or sizes of ownership affecting the property involved.	(e)	On any lot of less
than one acre in an &#x201C;RA&#x201D; or &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zone which was of record or held in
separate ownership on June 1,1946, or was subsequently created either by the
recording of a division of land map or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable zoning regulations, the originally required front yard shall be
provided and maintained on such lot in addition to any new front yard required
by any subsequent rearrangement of the lot lines by sale or division (without
recording a subdivision map) creating a new lot fronting on a different street
than that on which said original lot fronted.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 140,717,
Eff. 8/12/70.)	(f)	No accessory building shall be structurally altered,
converted, enlarged or maintained for the purpose of providing living quarters
or dwelling units unless such accessory building and all enlargements thereof
are made to conform to all the regulations of this article for new
buildings.	(g)	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; Every required
front, side and rear yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the
sky, except for those projections permitted by Sections 12.08.5, 12.09.5 and
12.22.	No automobile parking space shall be provided or maintained within a
required front yard. Except where a lot is developed with a building meeting the
requirements of Section 12.08.3B1, not more than 50 percent of a required front
yard shall be designed, improved or used for access driveways.	All portions of
the required front yard of one-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, multiple
dwellings or group dwellings, apartment houses, hotels, motels, apartment hotels
and retirement hotels in the RE, RS, R1, RU, RZ, R2, RD, R3, RAS3, R4, RAS4, R5,
or C Zones not used for necessary driveways and walkways, including decorative
walkways, shall be used for planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.&#xA0; The
planted area in the RD, R3, RAS3, R4, RAS4, R5, or C Zones shall be planted in
accordance with a landscape plan prepared by a licensed landscape architect,
licensed architect, or landscape contractor to the satisfaction of the
Department of City Planning.&#xA0; The planted area shall include at least one tree,
which shall be at least 15 gallon in size and at least six feet in height at the
time of planting, for each 500 square feet of planted area and shall be equipped
with an automatic irrigation system, which shall be properly maintained.&#xA0;
(Amended by Ord. No. 179,191, Eff. 11/5/07.)	A fee pursuant to Section 19.01I
shall be paid to the Department of City Planning for the checking of landscape
plans, pursuant to this paragraph. However, the fee shall be waived if any other
fee has been paid for checking of landscape plans for the same property.	No
swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water which is designed or used to
contain water 18 inches or more in depth shall be permitted in any required yard
space in which fences over 3-1/2 feet in height are prohibited, even though the
pool, pond or body of water extends below the adjacent natural ground
level.	(h)	At each end of a through lot there shall be a front yard of the depth
required by this article for the zone in which each street frontage is located,
except that only one front yard need be provided on those through lots which
abut on a primary, major or secondary highway, as such highways are shown on the
&#x201C;Highways and Freeways Element of the General Plan,&#x201D; when the rights to
vehicular ingress and egress from such through lots to the highway have been
abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction as a condition precedent to the
approval of the recordation of the subdivision in which such through lots are
included. Where only one front yard is required on a through lot, as provided
herein, the rear yard shall be located on the portion of such lot adjacent to
the highway.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 141,821, Eff. 5/24/71.)	Where a through lot
is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single building site, and
the two required front yards are provided, no rear yard is required.	(i)	No
required yard or other open space around an existing building shall be separated
in ownership from the portion of the lot upon which the building is
located.	(j)	The area of a lot upon which a building or use is located shall not
be reduced below the total area required for all of the dwelling units or guest
rooms contained in the building or required for the specific use, or required
because of the height or total floor area contained in the building, by
separating the ownership of a portion of the lot from that upon which the
building or use is located. No required lot which is provided for a dwelling
unit, guest room, specific use or total floor area within a building shall be
considered as providing the required lot area for any other dwelling unit, guest
room, specific use or total floor area within a building. (Amended by Ord. No.
110,225, Eff. 11/23/57.)	(k)	No lot or parcel of land held under separate
ownership at the time this article becomes effective shall be separated in
ownership or reduced in size below the minimum lot width or lot area required by
this article, nor shall any lot or parcel of land held under separate ownership
at the time this article becomes effective and which has a width or an area less
than that required by this article be further reduced in any manner.	(l)	In
determining the required side and rear yards of a building, any basement
containing habitable rooms shall be considered a story. (Added by Ord. No.
131,309, Eff. 4/24/66,)	See citation under Sec. 12.21-C,l, (a)	2.	Spaces Between
Buildings &#x2013; Passageways. &#x2013; When more than one residential building or a rear
residential building is located on a lot or the entrance to a residential
building is not directly from a street, the following passageways and other open
spaces shall be provided and maintained.	(a)	(Amended by Ord. No. 151,608, Eff.
11/26/78.)&#xA0; There shall be at least 20 feet of space between every two-story
apartment hotel, apartment house, boarding or rooming house, guest house hotel
or multiple dwelling, and any other main building on the same lot. Such space
may be reduced to 10 feet where the buildings are located on a corner lot and
the space opens directly onto the side street.	In the RD zone there shall be at
least 20 feet of space between every main building and any other main building
on the same lot where either of the buildings contains three or more dwelling
units.	In all other cases there shall be at least 10 feet of space between every
residential building and another main building on the same lot.	The width of the
space herein required shall be increased by two feet for each story over two
contained in any building adjoining said space.	Those regulations do not apply
to the spaces required between accessory buildings (not designed as residential
buildings) and other buildings on the same lot as otherwise provided for in
Subdivision 5 of this subsection.	(b)	There shall be a passageway of at least 10
feet in width extending from a street to one entrance of each dwelling unit or
guest room in every residential building, except those located in the RW, RU, or
RZ Zones, unless there is an entrance to the dwelling unit or guest room opening
directly onto a public street or into a hallway opening into a public street or
onto a l0-foot passageway extending to a public street. In the RW and RZ Zones,
there shall be a passageway at least 4 feet in width, and in the RU Zone, there
shall be a passageway at least 3 feet in width, extending from a street, or
public right-of-way in the case of the RW Zones, to one entrance of each
dwelling unit in every residential building. (Amended by Ord. No. 161,716, Eff.
12/6/86.)	The passageway shall be increased by two feet in width for each story
over two contained in any building located between the public street and the
building which the passageway serves. The passageway shall be located on the
same lot as the building which it serves.	Where a one story, one or two-family
dwelling has been continuously maintained on the front of a lot since prior to
June 1,1946, with a passageway of less than ten feet but not less than eight
feet in width from the street to the rear of said dwelling, an additional one or
two family dwelling may be erected and maintained on the rear of the lot,
provided the passageway is not further reduced. However, this limited passageway
shall be permitted where there are to be only two residential buildings on the
lot. (Amended by Ord. No. 108,661, Eff. 2/11/57.)	In addition to all other
applicable provisions herein, where a building or portion thereof is constructed
on or within an air space lot, and such building or portion thereof is used for
residential purposes, there shall be a passageway extending from a street to the
entrance of such building on the lot which has had the air space above or below
it divided by such air space lot or lots. (4th Para. Added by Ord. No. 156,681,
Eff. 6/21/82.)	(c)	In computing the width of a passageway where the passageway,
adjoins a lot line, the width of any required yard adjoining such lot line may
be assumed to be a portion of the required width of the passageway.	(d)	Any
space between buildings or any passageway having less width than that required
by this subdivision shall be maintained and shall not be further reduced in any
manner.	(e)	The passageways and other open spaces required by this subdivision
shall be open and unobstructed from ground to sky, except for the projections
permitted by the provisions of Section 12.22 C., and except that Solar
Structures that provide shade over the habitable area may cover up to 25% of the
required open space.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,110, Eff. 5/29/12.)	3.	Yards for
Institutions, Churches, etc. &#x2013; In the &#x201C;RA&#x201D; and &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zones, no building,
structure or land shall be used and no building shall be erected, structurally
altered, converted, enlarged or maintained for a hospital, institution, church,
library, museum or other similar use, unless the following yards are provided
and maintained:	(a)	For hospitals, institutions or similar uses, there shall be
a side yard on each side of said buildings of not less than 20% of the width of
the lot (except as permitted by (c) hereof, but such side yard need not exceed
25 feet, and shall be not less than ten feet in width where said yard adjoins
another lot in an &#x201C;RA&#x201D; or &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zone.	(b)	For churches, clubs, educational
institutions, elementary and high schools, libraries or museums, the combined
widths of the two side yards on an interior lot shall be not less than 40% of
the width of the lot, but need not exceed 50 feet, and on either an interior lot
or a corner lot the side yard adjoining another lot in an &#x201C;RA&#x201D; or &#x201C;R&#x201D;
Zone shall be not less than ten feet in width.	(c)	The side or rear yard
required for the buildings referred to in (a) and (b) hereof, which adjoin
property in a &#x201C;C&#x201D;, &#x201C;CM&#x201D; or &#x201C;M&#x201D; Zone, or the side yard which adjoins
the street side of a corner lot, may be the same as required for buildings in
the &#x201C;R4&#x201D; Zone. (Sec. 12.11 C.2. and 3.);	(d)	All other yards in connection
with buildings referred to in (a) and (b) hereof, shall comply with the
regulations on the zone in which the building is located.	(e)	For hospitals,
institutions, churches, libraries, museums or other similar uses located in a
building which combines residential and commercial uses pursuant to Section
12.22 A.18. (developments combining residential and commercial uses), the yard
requirements set forth in Section 12.22 A.18.(c) shall apply. (Added by Ord. No.
156,681, Eff. 6/21/82.)	(f)	(Added by Ord. No. 156,681, Eff. 6/21/82.)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, for
hospitals, institutions, churches, libraries, museums or other similar uses not
located in a building which combines residential and commercial uses, the
Director of Planning may apply the yard requirements set forth in Section 12.22
A.18.(c) if he finds:	(1)	the use is on a separate lot or air space lot from the
residential or commercial uses,	(2)	the use is an integral part of a project
which combines residential and commercial uses,	(3)	the yards permitted by
Section 12.22 A.18.(c) are compatible to the surrounding uses.	4.	Tennis or
Paddle Tennis Court Construction and Operation Standards and Regulations.&#xA0;

construction and operation standards and regulations for tennis or paddle tennis
courts constructed in the A and R Zones if the courts are accessory to the
primary residential use of the subject lots.&#xA0; The standards and regulations may
include, but are not limited to: hours of use, type of intensity of lighting and
the height and type of windscreens.&#xA0; The standards and regulations shall
reasonably restrict and minimize any detrimental effect of the location and
design and use of the courts on the occupants of adjoining properties and the
neighborhood.	5.	Location of Accessory Buildings and Tennis or Paddle Tennis
Courts &#x2013; No accessory building or tennis or paddle tennis court shall be
constructed, erected or maintained and no existing accessory building or tennis
or paddle tennis court shall be structurally altered, converted, enlarged, moved
or maintained unless such accessory building or tennis or paddle tennis court is
located on the lot in conformance with the following regulations: (Amended by
Ord. No. 151,466, Eff. 10/27/78.)	(a)	In the &#x201C;A&#x201D; and &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zones, every

157,144, Eff. 11/22/82.)	(b)	In the A and R Zones, all other accessory buildings
(not regulated by Paragraph (a) above or permitted in the front yard of a
sloping lot) shall be located on the rear half of a lot but need not be located
more than 55 feet from a front lot line. In the A1 and A2 Zones, such accessory
building shall be located not less than ten feet from any side street lot line,
and in the RA and R Zones shall be located not closer to the side street lot
line than the width of the side yard required for a main building of the same
height. (Amended by Ord. No. 121,925, Eff. 6/4/62.)	(c)	On a reversed corner
lot, an accessory building shall not be located nearer to the side lot line on
the street side of such corner lot than the front yard depth required on the lot
in the rear, nor be located nearer than five feet to the side lot line of such
lot. (Amended by Ord. No. 138,685, Eff. 7/10/69.)	(d)	In the A and R Zones, all
accessory buildings shall be located not less than ten feet from any main
building or accessory living quarters on the same lot. Provided, however, that
where an accessory building (other than a residential building) is not nearer to
the adjacent lot line than the width of the side yard required for a main
building of the same height, said accessory building and all its projections may
be not less than five feet from the side of a main building and all of its
projections. (Amended by Ord. No. 121,925, Eff. 6/4/62.)	(e)	In the A and R
Zones, any recreation room in an accessory building and any accessory building

a property in a more restrictive zone than that required for the main building
or main use to which it is accessory. The relationship between the more
restrictive and the less restrictive zones shall be determined by the sequence
of the zones set forth in Sec. 12.23-B,1(c), (Amended by Ord. No. 107,091, Eff.
4/13/56.)	(i)	In the C and M Zones an accessory building for a residential

subdivision, an accessory building may be located in any portion of a required
rear yard, and may be located on that portion of a required side yard which is
within 30 feet of the rear lot line. An accessory building may be located in a
side yard required for a building more than two stories in height if the

one-story accessory building for a single-family dwelling may be located in that
portion of a required side yard which is within 30 feet of the rear lot line or
in a required side yard if not closer than 75 feet to the front lot line nor
closer than ten feet to the main building. (Added by Ord. No. 125,278, Eff.
9/16/63.)	(k)	In the RA and R Zones where a through lot with no required rear
yard has a depth of 150 feet or more, an accessory building shall not extend
into either required front yard, except that it need not be more than 25 feet
from both front lot lines. (Added by Ord. No. 125,278, Eff. 9/16/63.)	Where such
through lot has a depth of less than 150 feet, an accessory building may be
located in one of the required front yards, if such building is set back from
the front lot line a distance of not less than ten per cent of the lot depth and
does not project beyond the front line of an existing main building along the
frontage, except that such building need not be located more than 25 feet from
both front lot lines.	No accessory building on a through lot shall be nearer to
any side lot line than the width of the side yard required for a main building
of the same height.	(l)	A private garage may be located on the required front
yard of a lot having a slope conforming to that specified in Section 12.22-C,6,
provided every portion of the garage building is at least five feet from the
front lot line. Where the wall of such garage is two-thirds below the natural or
finished grade of the lot, whichever is lower, said wall may extend to the
adjacent side lot line; in all other cases, said garage shall not be nearer to

151,466, Eff. 10/27/78.)	6.	Loading Space.	(a)	A loading space shall be provided
and maintained on the same lot with every hospital, hotel, or institution
building.&#xA0; A loading space shall be provided and maintained on the same lot
with every building in the C or M Zones where the lot on which said building is
located abuts an alley, provided that when the lot is occupied by a use, such as
a service station or a drive-in business, in which the building covers less than
the total buildable area, a suitable loading space must be provided, but it need
not comply with all the provisions of this section if its location, size and
means of access are approved by the Department of Building and Safety.&#xA0;
(Amended by Ord. No. 174,769, Eff. 9/26/02.)	EXCEPTION:&#xA0; No loading space shall
be required on a lot that abuts an alley in the C Zone when all the buildings
are erected, structurally altered, enlarged or maintained and used solely as
dwellings or apartment houses.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 174,769, Eff.
9/26/02.)	(b)	Every required loading space shall be so located and arranged that
delivery vehicles may be driven upon or into said space from the alley. Such
loading space shall have a minimum height of 14 feet and shall be directly
accessible through a usable door not less than three feet in width and not less
than six feet six inches in height opening from the building it is to serve.
(Amended by Ord. No. 138,685, Eff. 7/10/69.)	(c)	Every required loading space
shall have a minimum area of 400 square feet, a minimum width of 20 feet
measured along the alley line, and a minimum depth of ten feet measured
perpendicularly to the alley line except as hereafter provided in this
Subsection. Such loading space may be furnished within a building where said
building is designed and arranged to include accessible loading space equivalent
to that required by this subdivision.	(d)	The required loading space shall have
a minimum area of 600 square feet where the gross floor area of all buildings on
the lot exceeds 50,000 square feet, but not more than 100,000 square feet, a
minimum area of 800 square feet where the gross floor area of all buildings is
between 100,000 and 200,000 square feet, and shall be increased by an additional
200 square feet for each additional 200,000 square feet or fraction thereof of
gross floor area in the building.	(e)	The required loading space, on lots less
40 feet in width, shall extend across the full width of the lot at the alley
line, but need not exceed 10 feet in depth.	(f)	No loading space shall be
required on a lot on which a building, other than a residential building, is to
be erected, structurally altered, or enlarged, and on which there is an existing
separate building being lawfully maintained adjacent to the alley in such manner
as to prevent the establishment of the loading space required by the provisions
of this subdivision.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 130,952, Eff. 11/8/65.)	(g)	No
loading space shall be required on unusually shaped lots, oddly located lots, or
on hillside lots, when waived by the Department of Building and Safety as
provided for in Sec. 12.26-B.	(h)	Any loading space being maintained in
connection with an existing main building shall be maintained so long as the
building remains, provided, however, that this regulation shall not require the
maintenance of more loading space than is herein required for a new building,
nor the maintenance of such space in any other zone or for any other buildings
than those specified herein.	7.	Special Requirements for Corner Lots in the C
and M Zones. (Added by Ord. No. 143,825, Eff. 10/19/72.)	(a)	in addition to any
other requirements contained in this article, no building or structure shall be
erected within a visibility triangle, or portion thereof, on any lot in the C or
M Zones, except a corner lot subject to the provisions of Section 12.37, or
which complies with the provisions of Section 17.05-D,4 of this Code. Such
visibility triangle shall contain no structure or other obstruction to
visibility from two and one-half to ten feet above the adjacent curb levels. For
purposes of this subdivision a visibility triangle is defined as the area
bounded by:	(1)	The front lot line from its intersection with the side street
lot line to a point ten feet from said intersection;	(2)	The side street lot
line from its intersection with the front lot line to a point ten feet from said
intersection; and	(3)	A diagonal line joining said two points.	Nothing in this
subdivision shall prohibit the location of one column or pillar supporting an
upper story and having no horizontal dimension of more than 24 inches within the
visibility triangle.	(b)	The City Engineer may approve and allow such variations
from the aforesaid requirements as he determines are made necessary by the
conditions of the terrain.	(c)	Any person required to provide a visibility
triangle in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision may appeal any
determination made by the City Engineer to the Board of Public Works. Such an
appeal shall be made in writing and shall state in clear and concise language
the grounds therefor. The Board of Public Works may grant such waivers or
modifications of the requirements of this subdivision as it shall determine are
required to prevent any unreasonable hardship under the facts of each case so
long as such modifications or waivers are in conformity with the general spirit
and intent of the requirements of this subdivision.	(d)	The requirements of this
subdivision shall be in addition to those requirements set forth in Section
62.200 of this Code.	8.	Retaining Walls in Hillside Areas.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No.
176,445, Eff. 3/9/05.)&#xA0; This subdivision applies to retaining walls that meet
all of the following criteria:&#xA0; located in the A or R Zones (including the RA
Zone), located on land designated as a Hillside Area on the Bureau of
Engineering Basic Grid Map No. A-13372, and located on a lot developed or to be
developed with dwelling units.&#xA0; For purposes of this subdivision, a
&#x201C;retaining wall&#x201D; shall be defined as a freestanding continuous structure, as
viewed from the top, intended to support earth, which is not attached to a
building.&#xA0; Retaining walls are subject to the following restrictions:	(a)	A
maximum of one free standing vertical or approximately vertical retaining wall
may be built on any lot with a maximum height of 12 feet as measured from the
top of the wall to the lower side of the adjacent ground elevation.&#xA0; However,
as shown in the diagram below, a maximum of two vertical or approximately
vertical walls or portions of a wall can be built if they comply with the
following:	(i)	The minimum horizontal distance between the two walls is three
feet,	(ii)	Neither of the two walls exceed a height of 10 feet measured from the
top of each wall to the lower side of the adjacent ground elevation at each
wall, and	(iii)	In no case shall the height of a wall located in a required yard
exceed the height allowed by Section 12.22 C.20.(f) of this
Code.	(b)	Landscaping.&#xA0; For retaining walls of eight feet or greater in height,
the applicant must submit a landscape plan designed to completely hide the
retaining wall from view within a reasonable amount of time.&#xA0; The landscape
plan shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Planning in accordance
with Sections 12.40 through 12.43 of this Code and any Landscape Guidelines
established by the City Planning Commission.	(c)	Zoning Administrator approval
for taller walls or additional walls.&#xA0; Retaining walls that exceed the heights
or the maximum number allowed in paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall be
subject to the approval of a Zoning Administrator under Section 12.24 X.26. of
this Code.	(d)	Exception for public agency projects.&#xA0; This subdivision does not
apply to projects undertaken by a public agency.	(e)	Exception for prior
approved retaining walls.&#xA0; This subdivision does not apply to a retaining wall
that received a final discretionary approval, as determined by the Director of
Planning, from the City under another provision of the Code prior to the
effective date of the ordinance adding this new Subdivision 8. to Subsection C.
of Section 12.21 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.	(f)	Exception for retaining
walls required by Building and Safety.&#xA0; The provisions of this subdivision do
not apply to any retaining wall built to comply with an order issued by the
Department of Building and Safety to repair an unsafe or substandard
condition.	9.	Work Space for Joint Living and Work Quarters.&#xA0; (Added by Ord.
No. 181,133, Eff. 5/11/10.)&#xA0; The total floor area in a joint living and work
quarters shall be arranged to comply with one of the following standards:
&#xA0;	(a)	Tier 1 Standard &#x2013; Low Percentage of Work Space.&#xA0; At least ten percent
but no more than 25 percent of the total floor area in a joint living and work
quarters shall be work space; or	(b)	Tier 2 Standard &#x2013; Medium Percent-age of
Work Space.&#xA0; At least 25 percent but no more than 50 percent of the total floor
area in a joint living and work quarters shall be work space.	10.	Single-Family
Zone Hillside Area Development Standards.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 181,624, Eff.
5/9/11.)&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code to the contrary,
for any Lot zoned R1, RS, RE, or RA and designated Hillside Area on the
Department of City Planning Hillside Area Map, no Building or Structure nor the
enlargement of any Building or Structure shall be erected or maintained unless
the following development standards are provided and maintained in connection
with the Building, Structure, or enlargement:	(a)	Setback Requirements.&#xA0; No
Building or Structure shall be erected, maintained or enlarged unless the
setbacks as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-1 are provided and maintained in
connection with the Building, Structure, or&#xA0; enlargement.

Notwithstanding the required yards, or setbacks, outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-1
above, or those exceptions found in Section 12.22 of this Code, the following
provisions shall apply:	(1)	Prevailing Front Yard Setbacks.	(i)	Where there are
two or more developed Lots which have Front Yards that vary in depth by not more
than 10 feet, and such Lots comprise 40% or more of the Frontage, then the
minimum Front Yard depth shall be the average depth of the Front Yards of such
Lots.	(ii)	Where there are two or more possible combinations of developed Lots
comprising 40% or more of the Frontage, and these Lots have Front Yards that
vary in depth by not more than 10 feet, then the minimum Front Yard depth shall
be the average depth of the Front Yards of that combination which has the
shallowest average depth.	(iii)	In determining the required Front Yard, the
following shall not be taken into account:&#xA0; Buildings located on key Lots,
entirely on the rear half of Lots, or on Lots in the &#x201C;C&#x201D; or &#x201C;M&#x201D;
Zones.	(iv)	Nothing contained in this subparagraph (1) shall, however, be deemed
to require Front Yards which exceed 40 feet in depth.	(2)	Front Yard Setback on
Lots Fronting on Substandard Hillside Limited Street.&#xA0; For any Lot that fronts
on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, there shall be a minimum Front Yard
setback of at least five feet.&#xA0; However, the prevailing Front Yard setback
regulations, as outlined in Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a), shall apply,
so long as a Front Yard setback of no less than five feet is provided.	(3)	Front
Yard Setbacks on Key Lots.&#xA0; On Key Lots, the minimum Front Yard may be the
average of the required Front Yard for the adjoining Interior Lot and the
required Side Yard along the Street side of a Reversed Corner Lot.&#xA0; But such
minimum Front Yard may apply for a distance of not more than 85 feet from the
rear Lot line of the Reversed Corner Lot, beyond which point the Front Yard
specified in Table 12.21 C.10-1 or Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a) shall
apply.&#xA0; Where existing Buildings on either or both of said adjoining Lots are
located nearer to the front or side Lot lines than the Yard required by this
Paragraph (a), the Yards established by such existing buildings may be used in
computing the required Front Yard for a Key Lot.	(4)	Front Yard Setbacks on
Through Lots.&#xA0; At each end of a Through Lot, there shall be a Front Yard
setback as required by this Paragraph (a) for the zone in which each Street
Frontage is located.&#xA0; But only one Front Yard need be provided on those Through
Lots which abut on a primary, Major or Secondary Highway, as such highways are
shown on the &#x201C;Highways and Freeways Element of the General Plan&#x201D;, when the
rights to vehicular ingress and egress from such Through Lots to the highways
have been abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction.&#xA0; Where only one Front
Yard is required on a Through Lot, as provided herein, the Rear Yard shall be
located on the portion of such Lot adjacent to the highway.	Where a Through Lot
is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single Building site, and
the two required Front Yards are provided, no Rear Yard is required.	(5)	Front
Yard Paving.&#xA0; All portions of the required Front Yard not used for necessary
driveways and walkways, including decorative walkways, shall be used for
planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.	(6)	Front Yard on Lots Existing
Prior to June 1, 1946.&#xA0; This provision shall apply to any Lot of less than one
acre which was of record or held in separate ownership on June 1, 1946, or was
subsequently created either by the recording of a division of land map or
otherwise in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations.&#xA0; On any such
Lot, the originally required Front Yard shall be provided and maintained in
addition to any new Front Yard required by any subsequent rearrangement of the
Lot lines by sale or division (without recording a subdivision map) creating a
new Lot fronting on a different Street than that on which the original Lot
fronted.	(7)	Side and Rear Yards for Basements.&#xA0; In determining the required
Side and Rear Yards of a Building, any Basement containing Habitable Rooms shall
be considered a Story.	(8)	Yards in the Coastal Zone.&#xA0; The following setback
requirements shall apply to Lots located in a Coastal Zone:	(i)	On a Lot in the
RE9 or RE11 Zone, there shall be a Side Yard on each side of a main Building of
not less than 5 feet.&#xA0; Where the Lot is less than 50 feet in width, the Side
Yard may be reduced to 10% of the width of the Lot, but in no event less than 3
feet.	(ii)	In lieu of the additional Side Yard requirement in Table 12.21
C.10-1, for a Building more than two-stories in height on Lots in the R1, RS, or
RE Zone, one foot shall be added to the width of each required Side Yard for
each additional Story above the second Story.	(iii)	On a Lot in the RA Zone,
where a Side Yard is less than 10 feet in width, and the Building erected on the
Lot is three or more Stories in height, one foot shall be added to such Side
Yard.	(9)	Side Yards in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or
in Subdivision Approvals.&#xA0; Side Yard requirements in Specific Plans, Historic
Preservation Overlay Zones or in subdivision approvals shall take precedence
over requirements of this Subdivision 10.&#xA0; Otherwise, this Subdivision shall
apply.	(10)	Encroachments Into Required Yards.&#xA0; Every required Front, Side and
Rear Yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for
the following:	(i)	Garages in Front Yards.&#xA0; A Private Garage may be located on
the required Front Yard of a Lot where the Elevation of the ground at a point 50
feet from the front Lot line of a Lot and midway between the side Lot lines
differs 10 feet or more from the curb level, provided every portion of the
garage Building is at least 5 feet from the front Lot line.&#xA0; Where the wall of
such garage is two-thirds below natural or finished Grade of the Lot, whichever
is lower, said wall may extend to the adjacent side Lot line; in all other
cases, said garage shall not be nearer to the side Lot line than the width of
the Side Yard required for a main Building of the same height.	(ii)	Open,
Unenclosed Stairways, Porches, Platforms, Landing Places, or Balconies.&#xA0;
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, on Lots fronting onto a
Substandard Hillside Limited Street, open unenclosed stairways, porches,
platforms and landing places not covered by a roof or canopy shall not project
or extend into the Front Yard.&#xA0; Balconies with 10 feet or more of vertical
clearance beneath them may project or extend no more than 30 inches into a Front
Yard.	(iii)	Other Exceptions.&#xA0; All of those exceptions found in Subdivision 5.
of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 and in Section 12.22 of this Code.	(11)	Pools,
Ponds, or Body of Water in Required Yards.&#xA0; No swimming pool, fish pond or
other body of water which is designed or used to contain water 18 inches or more
in depth shall be permitted in any required Yard Space in which fences over 42
inches in height are prohibited, even though the pool, pond or body of water
extends below the adjacent natural ground level.	(12)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s
Authority.&#xA0; For Lots fronting on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, a
Zoning Administrator may grant a reduction of the front Setback requirements of
Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph and Side Yard requirements in Table 12.21
C.10-1, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28.
of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code; however, in no event shall the
Side Yard be less than 4 feet.	(b)	Maximum Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; The maximum
Residential Floor Area contained in all Buildings and Accessory Buildings shall
not exceed the sum of the square footage of each Slope Band multiplied by the
corresponding Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for the zone of the Lot, as outlined in
Table 12.21 C.10-2a.&#xA0; This formula can be found in Table 12.21 C.10-2b, where
&#x201C;A&#x201D; is the area of the Lot within each Slope Band, &#x201C;FAR&#x201D; is the FAR of
the corresponding Slope Band, and &#x201C;RFA&#x201D; is the sum of the Residential Floor
Area of each Slope Band.

	(1)	Slope Analysis Map.&#xA0; As part of an application for a permit to the
Department of Building and Safety, or for a Discretionary Approval as defined in
Section 16.05 B. of this Code to the Department of City Planning, the applicant
shall submit a Slope Analysis Map based on a survey of the natural/existing
topography, prepared, stamped, and signed by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, to verify the total area (in square feet) of the
portions of a property within each Slope Band identified in Table 12.21
C.10-2a.&#xA0; The Director of Planning, or his/her designee, shall verify that the
Slope Analysis Map has been prepared by a registered civil engineer or licensed
land surveyor.&#xA0; In addition, the Director of Planning, or his/her designee
shall approve the calculated Maximum Residential Floor Area for the Lot by the
registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor using the Slope Analysis Map
prior to applying for a permit from the Department of Building and Safety.	The
map shall have a scale of not less than 1 inch to 100 feet and a contour
interval of not more than 10 feet with two-foot intermediates.&#xA0; The map shall
also indicate the datum, source, and scale of topographic data used in the Slope
analysis, and shall attest to the fact that the Slope analysis has been
accurately calculated.	The Slope Analysis Map shall clearly delineate/identify
the Slope Bands (i.e. with contrasting colors or hatching), and shall include a
tabulation of the total area in square-feet within each Slope Band, as well as
the FAR and Residential Floor Area value of each corresponding Slope Band as
shown on Table 12.21 C.10-2b.	The Slope Analysis Map shall be prepared using
CAD-based, GIS-based, or other type of software specifically designed for such
purpose.	(2)	Guaranteed Minimum Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; Notwithstanding the
above, the maximum Residential Floor Area for all Buildings and Accessory
Buildings on any Lot may be least the percentage of the Lot size as outlined in
Table 12.21 C.10-3 below or 1,000 square feet, whichever is greater.

	The guaranteed minimum for the original zone as stated in the paragraph above
shall apply to Lots that meet the following criteria:&#xA0; have an area that is
less than 50% of the minimum Lot size for its Zone, were made nonconforming in
Lot size as a result of an adopted zone change or code amendment changing the
minimum Lot size, and met the minimum Lot size requirements of the original
zone.	(3)	Residential Floor Area Bonus.&#xA0; An additional 20% of the maximum
Residential Floor Area as determined by Table 12.21 C.10-2 of this Paragraph
(b), or an additional 30% for Lots where the guaranteed minimum outlined in
Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph (b) is utilized, for that Lot shall be
allowed if any of the options listed below is utilized.&#xA0; Only one bonus per
property is allowed.	(i)	Proportional Stories Option.&#xA0; The total Residential
Floor Area of each Story other than the Base Floor in a multi-Story Building
does not exceed 75% of the Base Floor Area. This option shall only apply to flat
Building pads where the Slope of the Building pad area prior to any Grading, as
measured from the highest and lowest Elevation points of the existing Grade
within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of the proposed Building or
Structure, is less than 15%; or	(ii)	Front Facade Stepback Option.&#xA0; The
cumulative length of the exterior walls which are not a part of a garage facing
the Front Lot Line, equal to a minimum of 25% of the Building width, shall be
stepped-back a distance of at least 20% of the Building depth from a plane
parallel to the Lot width established at the point of the Building closest to
the Front Lot line.&#xA0; When the Front Lot line is not straight, a line connecting
the points where the Side Lot lines and the Front Lot line intersect shall be
used to establish the plane parallel to the front Lot width.&#xA0; When Through Lots
have, or are required to provide, two Front Yard setbacks, the step-back shall
be provided along both Front Lot Lines.&#xA0; When referred by the Department of
Building and Safety, for unusual Building and/or Lot configuration, the Director
of Planning or his/her designee shall determine that the proposed project
complies with this provision and qualifies for a Residential Floor Area
bonus.	For the purposes of this provision, all exterior walls that intersect a
plane parallel to the Front Lot Line at 45 degrees or less shall be considered
to be facing the Front Lot Line.&#xA0; The Building width shall be the greatest
distance between the exterior walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot
width.&#xA0; The Building depth shall be the greatest distance between the exterior
walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot depth.	This option shall only
apply to Structures which are no more than 35 feet from the Frontage along an
improved Street and on a &#x201C;flat&#x201D; Building pad where the Slope of the Building
pad prior to any Grading, as measured from the highest point of the existing
Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior wall of the proposed Building or
Structure to the lowest point of the existing natural Grade within 5 horizontal
feet, is less than 15%; or	(iii)	Cumulative Side Yard Setbacks Option.&#xA0; The
combined width of Side Yards shall be at least 25% of the total Lot Width, as
defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, but in no event shall a single Side Yard
setback be less than 10% of the Lot Width or the minimum required by Paragraph
(a) of this Subdivision, whichever is greater.&#xA0; One foot shall be added to each
required Side Yard for each increment of 10 feet or fraction thereof of height
above the first 18 feet of height.&#xA0; The width of a required Side Yard setback
shall be maintained for the entire length of a Side Yard and cannot alternate
from one Side Yard to the other; or	(iv)	18-Foot Envelope Height Option.&#xA0; For
properties which are not in the &#x201C;1SS&#x201D; Single-Story Height District, the
maximum envelope height, measured pursuant to Subparagraph (1) of Paragraph (d)
of this Subdivision 10., shall be no more than 18 feet; or&#xA0;	(v)	Multiple
Structures Option.&#xA0; In addition to the Lot coverage requirements in Paragraph
(e) of this Subdivision, any one Building and Structure extending more than 6
feet above Hillside Area Grade, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, shall
cover no more than 20% of the area of a Lot.&#xA0; Such Buildings or Structures may
only be connected by one breezeway, fully enclosed walkway, elevator, or
combination thereof of not more than 5 feet in width; or	(vi)	Minimal Grading
Option.&#xA0; For properties where at least 60% of the Lot is comprised of Slopes
which are 30% or greater, as determined by a Slope Analysis Map prepared in
accordance with Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (b), the total amount of any
Grading on the site (including exempted Grading, as outlined in Paragraph (f) of
this Subdivision (10)) does not exceed the numeric value of 10% of the total Lot
size in cubic yards or 1,000 cubic yards, whichever is less (example:&#xA0; a
project involving 500 cubic-yards of Grading on a 5,000 square-foot Lot will be
eligible for this bonus option); or	(vii)	Green Building Option.&#xA0; For a new
One-Family Dwelling only, the new construction must satisfy the Tier 1
requirements or higher of the LA Green Building Code, as defined in Section
99.01.101.1 of this Code.	(4)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.	(i)	10%
Adjustments.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator has the authority to grant adjustments
from the requirements of this Paragraph (b) of not more than 10%, pursuant to
the authority and procedures established in Subsection A. of Section 12.28 of
this Code.	(ii)	Additions to Structures Existing Prior to August 1, 2010.&#xA0; The
Zoning Administrator has the authority to approve any additions made after
August 1, 2010,&#xA0; to a One-Family Dwelling existing prior to that date for which
permits have been previously obtained which exceed the requirements of this
Paragraph (b), pursuant to the authority and procedures established in
Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code, provided:	a.	the
total cumulative Residential Floor Area of all such additions does not exceed
1,000 square feet; and&#xA0;	b.	the resulting Building does not exceed the height of
the original Building or the height permitted in Paragraph (d) of this
Subdivision 10. below, whichever is greater; and&#xA0;	c.	at least two off-street
covered parking spaces are provided.	(c)	Verification of Existing Residential
Floor Area.&#xA0; For additions with cumulative Residential Floor Area of less than
1,000 square feet constructed after August 1, 2010, or remodels of Buildings
built prior to August 1, 2010, the existing Residential Floor Area shall be the
same as the Building square footage shown on the most recent Los Angeles County
Tax Assessor&#x2019;s records at the time the plans are submitted to the Department
of Building and Safety and a plan check fee is paid.&#xA0; Except that Residential
Floor Area may be calculated as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code when a
complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area calculations of all the
Structures on the Lot, prepared by a licensed architect or engineer, is
submitted by the applicant.	Any work that does not qualify as a remodel, as
defined in the paragraph below, or additions that are 1,000 square feet or
larger shall require a complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area
calculations of all the Structures on the Lot prepared by a licensed architect
or engineer.	For the purposes of implementing this Paragraph (c), a remodel
shall mean the alteration of an existing Building or Structure provided that at
least 50 percent of the perimeter length of the contiguous exterior walls and 50
percent of the roof are retained.	(d)	Height Limits.&#xA0; No portion of a Building
or Structure shall be erected or enlarged which exceeds the envelope height
limits as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-4, or as otherwise stated in the
paragraphs below.&#xA0; For the provisions below, whenever Grade is mentioned, it
shall mean Hillside Area Grade as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code.

	(1)	Measurement of Height.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code,
the height limits in Table 12.21 C.10-4 shall be measured as set forth
below.	(i)	Maximum Envelope Height.&#xA0; Envelope height (otherwise known as
vertical height or &#x201C;plumb line&#x201D; height) shall be the vertical distance from
the Grade of the site to a projected plane at the roof Structure or parapet wall
located directly above and parallel to the Grade.&#xA0; Measurement of the envelope
height shall originate at the lowest Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the
exterior walls of a Building or Structure.&#xA0; At no point shall any given section
of any part of the proposed Building or Structure exceed the maximum envelope
height.	A topographic map shall be submitted as a separate plan sheet or as part
of the site plan identifying the 5-foot perimeter of the exterior walls, or any
other information which the Department of Building and Safety deems necessary to
determine compliance with this Paragraph (i).	(2)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s
Authority.&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may allow Structures which exceed the
maximum envelope height requirements of Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (d);
however, the increase in height may not result in a Building or Structure which
exceeds an overall height of 45 feet, pursuant to the authority and procedures
established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code.&#xA0;
The overall height shall be measured from the lowest Elevation point within 5
horizontal feet of the exterior walls of a Building or Structure to the highest
Elevation point of the roof Structure or parapet wall.	(3)	Prevailing Height.&#xA0;
Notwithstanding Table 12.21 C.10-4 of this Paragraph (d), when 40% or more of
the existing One-Family Dwellings with Frontage on both sides of the block have
Building heights exceeding these limits, the maximum envelope height for any
Building on that block may be the average height of the Dwellings exceeding
these limits.	(4)	Lots in a Single-Story Height District.&#xA0; As enabled by
Section 12.21.1 A.1. of this Code, on Lots in a &#x201C;SS&#x201D; Single Story Height
District, shown as &#x201C;1SS&#x201D; on a Zoning Map, no Building or Structure shall be
erected or enlarged which exceeds one Story.	Notwithstanding the provision in
Section 12.21.1 A.8., in determining the number of Stories, any Basement which
is exempt from the Residential Floor Area calculation, as outlined in Section
12.03 of this Code, shall not be considered a Story.	(5)	Lots Fronting on
Substandard Hillside Limited Streets.&#xA0; For any Lot fronting onto a Substandard
Hillside Limited Street, as defined in Section 12.03, and subject to the 5-foot
Front Yard setback, no portion of a Building or Structure within 20 feet of the
Front Lot Line shall exceed 24 feet in height.&#xA0; The 24 foot maximum Building
and Structure height shall be measured from the Elevation at the centerline or
midpoint of the Street on which the Lot fronts.	(6)	Unenclosed/Uncovered Rooftop
Decks and Cantilevered Balconies.&#xA0; Unenclosed/uncovered rooftop decks,
cantilevered balconies and &#x201C;visually permeable railing&#x201D; (no more than 42
inches in height), may project beyond the maximum envelope height, as limited
and measured in Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (d), no more than 5
horizontal feet.	For the purposes of this Subparagraph (6), &#x201C;visually
permeable railing&#x201D; means railing constructed of material that is transparent,
such as glass or plastic panels, or wrought iron or other solid material which
is 80% open to light and air.	(7)	Roof Structures.&#xA0; Roof Structures as
described in Table 12.21 C.10-5 below, or similar Structures, may be erected
above the height limit specified in Table 12.21 C.10-4.

Such loading space may be furnished within a building where said building is designed and arranged to include accessible loading space equivalent to that required by this subdivision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(d)	The required loading space shall have a minimum area of 600 square feet where the gross floor area of all buildings on the lot exceeds 50,000 square feet, but not more than 100,000 square feet, a minimum area of 800 square feet where the gross floor area of all buildings is between 100,000 and 200,000 square feet, and shall be increased by an additional 200 square feet for each additional 200,000 square feet or fraction thereof of gross floor area in the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(e)	The required loading space, on lots less 40 feet in width, shall extend across the full width of the lot at the alley line, but need not exceed 10 feet in depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(f)	No loading space shall be required on a lot on which a building, other than a residential building, is to be erected, structurally altered, or enlarged, and on which there is an existing separate building being lawfully maintained adjacent to the alley in such manner as to prevent the establishment of the loading space required by the provisions of this subdivision.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 130,952, Eff. 11/8/65.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(g)	No loading space shall be required on unusually shaped lots, oddly located lots, or on hillside lots, when waived by the Department of Building and Safety as provided for in Sec. 12.26-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(h)	Any loading space being maintained in connection with an existing main building shall be maintained so long as the building remains, provided, however, that this regulation shall not require the maintenance of more loading space than is herein required for a new building, nor the maintenance of such space in any other zone or for any other buildings than those specified herein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	7.	Special Requirements for Corner Lots in the C and M Zones. (Added by Ord.

Such visibility triangle shall contain no structure or other obstruction to visibility from two and one-half to ten feet above the adjacent curb levels. For purposes of this subdivision a visibility triangle is defined as the area bounded by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(1)	The front lot line from its intersection with the side street lot line to a point ten feet from said intersection;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(2)	The side street lot line from its intersection with the front lot line to a point ten feet from said intersection; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(3)	A diagonal line joining said two points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the location of one column or pillar supporting an upper story and having no horizontal dimension of more than 24 inches within the visibility triangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(b)	The City Engineer may approve and allow such variations from the aforesaid requirements as he determines are made necessary by the conditions of the terrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(c)	Any person required to provide a visibility triangle in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision may &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; any determination made by the City Engineer to the Board of Public Works. Such an &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; shall be made in writing and shall state in clear and concise language the grounds therefor. The Board of Public Works may grant such &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;waivers&lt;/span&gt; or modifications of the requirements of this subdivision as it shall determine are required to prevent any unreasonable hardship under the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;facts&lt;/span&gt; of each case so long as such modifications or &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;waivers&lt;/span&gt; are in conformity with the general spirit and &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt; of the requirements of this subdivision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(d)	The requirements of this subdivision shall be in addition to those requirements set forth in Section 62.200 of this Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	8.

  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Notwithstanding the required yards, or setbacks, outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-1 above, or those exceptions found in Section 12.22 of this Code, the following provisions shall apply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(1)	Prevailing Front Yard Setbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	Where there are two or more developed Lots which have Front Yards that vary in depth by not more than 10 feet, and such Lots comprise 40% or more of the Frontage, then the minimum Front Yard depth shall be the average depth of the Front Yards of such Lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(ii)	Where there are two or more possible combinations of developed Lots comprising 40% or more of the Frontage, and these Lots have Front Yards that vary in depth by not more than 10 feet, then the minimum Front Yard depth shall be the average depth of the Front Yards of that combination which has the shallowest average depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(iii)	In determining the required Front Yard, the following shall not be taken into account:&#xA0; Buildings located on key Lots, entirely on the rear half of Lots, or on Lots in the &#x201C;C&#x201D; or &#x201C;M&#x201D; Zones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(iv)	Nothing contained in this subparagraph (1) shall, however, be deemed to require Front Yards which exceed 40 feet in depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(2)	Front Yard Setback on Lots Fronting on Substandard Hillside Limited Street.&#xA0; For any Lot that fronts on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, there shall be a minimum Front Yard setback of at least five feet.&#xA0; However, the prevailing Front Yard setback regulations, as outlined in Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a), shall apply, so long as a Front Yard setback of no less than five feet is provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(3)	Front Yard Setbacks on Key Lots.&#xA0; On Key Lots, the minimum Front Yard may be the average of the required Front Yard for the adjoining Interior Lot and the required Side Yard along the Street side of a Reversed Corner Lot.&#xA0; But such minimum Front Yard may apply for a distance of not more than 85 feet from the rear Lot line of the Reversed Corner Lot, beyond which point the Front Yard specified in Table 12.21 C.10-1 or Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a) shall apply.&#xA0; Where existing Buildings on either or both of said adjoining Lots are located nearer to the front or side Lot lines than the Yard required by this Paragraph (a), the Yards established by such existing buildings may be used in computing the required Front Yard for a Key Lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(4)	Front Yard Setbacks on Through Lots.&#xA0; At each end of a Through Lot, there shall be a Front Yard setback as required by this Paragraph (a) for the zone in which each Street Frontage is located.&#xA0; But only one Front Yard need be provided on those Through Lots which abut on a primary, Major or Secondary Highway, as such highways are shown on the &#x201C;Highways and Freeways Element of the General Plan&#x201D;, when the rights to vehicular ingress and egress from such Through Lots to the highways have been abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction.&#xA0; Where only one Front Yard is required on a Through Lot, as provided herein, the Rear Yard shall be located on the portion of such Lot adjacent to the highway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Where a Through Lot is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single Building site, and the two required Front Yards are provided, no Rear Yard is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(5)	Front Yard Paving.&#xA0; All portions of the required Front Yard not used for necessary driveways and walkways, including decorative walkways, shall be used for planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(6)	Front Yard on Lots Existing Prior to June 1, 1946.&#xA0; This provision shall apply to any Lot of less than one acre which was of record or held in separate ownership on June 1, 1946, or was subsequently created either by the recording of a division of land map or otherwise in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations.&#xA0; On any such Lot, the originally required Front Yard shall be provided and maintained in addition to any new Front Yard required by any subsequent rearrangement of the Lot lines by sale or division (without recording a subdivision map) creating a new Lot fronting on a different Street than that on which the original Lot fronted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(7)	Side and Rear Yards for Basements.&#xA0; In determining the required Side and Rear Yards of a Building, any Basement containing Habitable Rooms shall be considered a Story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(8)	Yards in the Coastal Zone.&#xA0; The following setback requirements shall apply to Lots located in a Coastal Zone:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	On a Lot in the RE9 or RE11 Zone, there shall be a Side Yard on each side of a main Building of not less than 5 feet.&#xA0; Where the Lot is less than 50 feet in width, the Side Yard may be reduced to 10% of the width of the Lot, but in no event less than 3 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(ii)	In lieu of the additional Side Yard requirement in Table 12.21 C.10-1, for a Building more than two-stories in height on Lots in the R1, RS, or RE Zone, one foot shall be added to the width of each required Side Yard for each additional Story above the second Story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(iii)	On a Lot in the RA Zone, where a Side Yard is less than 10 feet in width, and the Building erected on the Lot is three or more Stories in height, one foot shall be added to such Side Yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(9)	Side Yards in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in Subdivision Approvals.&#xA0; Side Yard requirements in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in subdivision approvals shall take precedence over requirements of this Subdivision 10.&#xA0; Otherwise, this Subdivision shall apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(10)	Encroachments Into Required Yards.&#xA0; Every required Front, Side and Rear Yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	Garages in Front Yards.&#xA0; A Private Garage may be located on the required Front Yard of a Lot where the Elevation of the ground at a point 50 feet from the front Lot line of a Lot and midway between the side Lot lines differs 10 feet or more from the curb level, provided every portion of the garage Building is at least 5 feet from the front Lot line.&#xA0; Where the wall of such garage is two-thirds below natural or finished Grade of the Lot, whichever is lower, said wall may extend to the adjacent side Lot line; in all other cases, said garage shall not be nearer to the side Lot line than the width of the Side Yard required for a main Building of the same height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(ii)	Open, Unenclosed Stairways, Porches, Platforms, Landing Places, or Balconies.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, on Lots fronting onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, open unenclosed stairways, porches, platforms and landing places not covered by a roof or canopy shall not project or extend into the Front Yard.&#xA0; Balconies with 10 feet or more of vertical clearance beneath them may project or extend no more than 30 inches into a Front Yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(iii)	Other Exceptions.&#xA0; All of those exceptions found in Subdivision 5. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 and in Section 12.22 of this Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(11)	Pools, Ponds, or Body of Water in Required Yards.&#xA0; No swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water which is designed or used to contain water 18 inches or more in depth shall be permitted in any required Yard Space in which fences over 42 inches in height are prohibited, even though the pool, pond or body of water extends below the adjacent natural ground level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(12)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.&#xA0; For Lots fronting on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, a Zoning Administrator may grant a reduction of the front Setback requirements of Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph and Side Yard requirements in Table 12.21 C.10-1, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code; however, in no event shall the Side Yard be less than 4 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(b)	Maximum Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; The maximum Residential Floor Area contained in all Buildings and &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Accessory&lt;/span&gt; Buildings shall not exceed the sum of the square footage of each Slope Band multiplied by the corresponding Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for the zone of the Lot, as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-2a.&#xA0; This formula can be found in Table 12.21 C.10-2b, where &#x201C;A&#x201D; is the area of the Lot within each Slope Band, &#x201C;FAR&#x201D; is the FAR of the corresponding Slope Band, and &#x201C;RFA&#x201D; is the sum of the Residential Floor Area of each Slope Band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	The guaranteed minimum for the original zone as stated in the paragraph above shall apply to Lots that meet the following criteria:&#xA0; have an area that is less than 50% of the minimum Lot size for its Zone, were made nonconforming in Lot size as a result of an adopted zone change or code amendment changing the minimum Lot size, and met the minimum Lot size requirements of the original zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(3)	Residential Floor Area Bonus.&#xA0; An additional 20% of the maximum Residential Floor Area as determined by Table 12.21 C.10-2 of this Paragraph (b), or an additional 30% for Lots where the guaranteed minimum outlined in Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph (b) is utilized, for that Lot shall be allowed if any of the options listed below is utilized.&#xA0; Only one bonus per property is allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	Proportional Stories Option.&#xA0; The total Residential Floor Area of each Story other than the Base Floor in a multi-Story Building does not exceed 75% of the Base Floor Area. This option shall only apply to flat Building pads where the Slope of the Building pad area prior to any Grading, as measured from the highest and lowest Elevation points of the existing Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of the proposed Building or Structure, is less than 15%; or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(ii)	Front Facade Stepback Option.&#xA0; The cumulative length of the exterior walls which are not a part of a garage facing the Front Lot Line, equal to a minimum of 25% of the Building width, shall be stepped-back a distance of at least 20% of the Building depth from a plane parallel to the Lot width established at the point of the Building closest to the Front Lot line.&#xA0; When the Front Lot line is not straight, a line connecting the points where the Side Lot lines and the Front Lot line intersect shall be used to establish the plane parallel to the front Lot width.&#xA0; When Through Lots have, or are required to provide, two Front Yard setbacks, the step-back shall be provided along both Front Lot Lines.&#xA0; When referred by the Department of Building and Safety, for unusual Building and/or Lot configuration, the Director of Planning or his/her designee shall determine that the proposed project complies with this provision and qualifies for a Residential Floor Area bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	For the purposes of this provision, all exterior walls that intersect a plane parallel to the Front Lot Line at 45 degrees or less shall be considered to be facing the Front Lot Line.&#xA0; The Building width shall be the greatest distance between the exterior walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot width.&#xA0; The Building depth shall be the greatest distance between the exterior walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	This option shall only apply to Structures which are no more than 35 feet from the Frontage along an improved Street and on a &#x201C;flat&#x201D; Building pad where the Slope of the Building pad prior to any Grading, as measured from the highest point of the existing Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior wall of the proposed Building or Structure to the lowest point of the existing natural Grade within 5 horizontal feet, is less than 15%; or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(iii)	Cumulative Side Yard Setbacks Option.&#xA0; The combined width of Side Yards shall be at least 25% of the total Lot Width, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, but in no event shall a single Side Yard setback be less than 10% of the Lot Width or the minimum required by Paragraph (a) of this Subdivision, whichever is greater.&#xA0; One foot shall be added to each required Side Yard for each increment of 10 feet or fraction thereof of height above the first 18 feet of height.&#xA0; The width of a required Side Yard setback shall be maintained for the entire length of a Side Yard and cannot alternate from one Side Yard to the other; or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(iv)	18-Foot Envelope Height Option.&#xA0; For properties which are not in the &#x201C;1SS&#x201D; Single-Story Height District, the maximum envelope height, measured pursuant to Subparagraph (1) of Paragraph (d) of this Subdivision 10., shall be no more than 18 feet; or&#xA0;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(v)	Multiple Structures Option.&#xA0; In addition to the Lot coverage requirements in Paragraph (e) of this Subdivision, any one Building and Structure extending more than 6 feet above Hillside Area Grade, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, shall cover no more than 20% of the area of a Lot.&#xA0; Such Buildings or Structures may only be connected by one breezeway, fully enclosed walkway, elevator, or combination thereof of not more than 5 feet in width; or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(vi)	Minimal Grading Option.&#xA0; For properties where at least 60% of the Lot is comprised of Slopes which are 30% or greater, as determined by a Slope Analysis Map prepared in accordance with Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (b), the total amount of any Grading on the site (including exempted Grading, as outlined in Paragraph (f) of this Subdivision (10)) does not exceed the numeric value of 10% of the total Lot size in cubic yards or 1,000 cubic yards, whichever is less (example:&#xA0; a project involving 500 cubic-yards of Grading on a 5,000 square-foot Lot will be eligible for this bonus option); or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(vii)	Green Building Option.&#xA0; For a new One-Family Dwelling only, the new construction must satisfy the Tier 1 requirements or higher of the LA Green Building Code, as defined in Section 99.01.101.1 of this Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(4)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	10% Adjustments.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator has the authority to grant adjustments from the requirements of this Paragraph (b) of not more than 10%, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subsection A. of Section 12.28 of this Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(ii)	Additions to Structures Existing Prior to August 1, 2010.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator has the authority to approve any additions made after August 1, 2010,&#xA0; to a One-Family Dwelling existing prior to that date for which permits have been previously obtained which exceed the requirements of this Paragraph (b), pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code, provided:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	a.	the total cumulative Residential Floor Area of all such additions does not exceed 1,000 square feet; and&#xA0;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	b.	the resulting Building does not exceed the height of the original Building or the height permitted in Paragraph (d) of this Subdivision 10. below, whichever is greater; and&#xA0;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	c.	at least two off-street covered parking spaces are provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(c)	Verification of Existing Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; For additions with cumulative Residential Floor Area of less than 1,000 square feet constructed after August 1, 2010, or remodels of Buildings built prior to August 1, 2010, the existing Residential Floor Area shall be the same as the Building square footage shown on the most recent Los Angeles County Tax Assessor&#x2019;s records at the time the plans are submitted to the Department of Building and Safety and a plan check fee is paid.&#xA0; Except that Residential Floor Area may be calculated as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code when a complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area calculations of all the Structures on the Lot, prepared by a licensed architect or engineer, is submitted by the applicant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Any work that does not qualify as a remodel, as defined in the paragraph below, or additions that are 1,000 square feet or larger shall require a complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area calculations of all the Structures on the Lot prepared by a licensed architect or engineer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	For the purposes of implementing this Paragraph (c), a remodel shall mean the alteration of an existing Building or Structure provided that at least 50 percent of the perimeter length of the contiguous exterior walls and 50 percent of the roof are retained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(d)	Height Limits.&#xA0; No portion of a Building or Structure shall be erected or enlarged which exceeds the envelope height limits as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-4, or as otherwise stated in the paragraphs below.&#xA0; For the provisions below, whenever Grade is mentioned, it shall mean Hillside Area Grade as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(Added by Ord. No. 174,132, Eff. 9/3/01.)&#xA0; Wireless Telecommunication Facilities (WTF) Standards &#x2013; Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary, the following standards shall apply to the placement of all wireless telecommunication facilities.&#xA0; These standards shall not apply to satellite dish antennae, radio and television transmitters and antennae incidental to residential use.	(a)	General Requirements	(1)	Antenna Requirements.&#xA0; The antenna on any monopole or support structure must meet the minimum siting distances to habitable structures required for compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations and standards governing the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.&#xA0; The grouping of WTF on a site is encouraged where technically feasible.&#xA0; The footing of the antenna shall be structurally designed to support a monopole which is at least 15 feet higher than the monopole under review, while being within the applicable requirements of the height district, in order to allow a future wireless network to replace an existing monopole with a new monopole capable of supporting co-location.	If it is determined that additional height is necessary to support co-location, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to consider reasonable modifications to pole height, and the co-location of additional equipment within the 15 feet extension limit pursuant to Section 12.24W49 of this Code.	Monopoles, dishes and other antenna equipment not regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall have a non-reflective&#xA0; finish to minimize the visibility of the structure and not be illuminated, unless required by the FAA.	(2)	Antenna Setback	(i)	Monopole setback.&#xA0; Monopoles shall be designed at the minimum functional height.&#xA0; All monopoles shall be set back a distance equal to 20 percent of the height of the monopole, from all abutting streets, residential uses, and in all zones, or areas with access to the public, unless a qualified structural engineer specifies in writing that any collapse of the pole will occur within a lesser distance under all foreseeable circumstances.	The monopole shall be certified by a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of California to meet any structural standards for steel antenna towers and structures set in the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association Standards referenced as EIA/TIA-222-E and as amended.&#xA0; Monopoles shall meet the main building setback requirements of the underlying zone.&#xA0; The setback shall be sufficient to:	a.	provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as set forth in Subparagraph (5) (Screening) and (6) (Landscaping) of Paragraph (a) of this subsection;	b.	preserve the privacy of adjoining residential property; and	c.	protect adjoining property from the potential impact of pole failure.	(ii)	Attached or Roof Mounted Antenna Setback.&#xA0; Roof mounted antennas shall be located at the greatest feasible distance from the edge of the building.&#xA0; Equipment facilities and antennas shall not extend more than ten feet above the highest point of the roof top, unless mounted on the walls of a penthouse.	(3)	Locating Antenna at Existing Sites.&#xA0; An effort shall be made to locate new WTF on existing approved structures or sites, when feasible.	(4)	Visual impact.&#xA0; The WTF shall be designed to have the least possible visual impact on the environment, taking into consideration technical, engineering, economic and other pertinent factors.&#xA0; Antennas clustered at the same site shall be of the same general height and facilities of the same design.	(5)	Screening	(i)	Ground, roof and pole mounted antennas shall be screened by fencing, buildings or parapets that appear to be an integral part of the building or landscaping so that not more than 25 percent of the combined tower structure and antenna height is visible from grade level of adjoining property and adjoining public rights-of-way.	(ii)	Dish antennas shall not be light reflective or have any sign copy on them nor shall they be illuminated, unless required by the FAA.	(iii)	Building mounted antennas shall be screened from view under most circumstances, if the antennas would otherwise be visible to adjacent properties and adjacent public rights-of-way.	Omni-directional antennas may not be required to be screened if it is demonstrated that the screening device would create a greater visual impact than the unscreened antennas.	The screening shall include parapets, walls or similar architectural elements provided that it is painted and textured to integrate with the architecture of the building.	As an alternative screening method, landscaping positioned on the premises to screen antennas from adjacent properties may be proposed in lieu of, or in combination with, architectural screening.&#xA0; Antennas shall be mounted on the parapet, penthouse wall or facade, building mounted antennas shall be painted and textured or otherwise architecturally integrated to match the existing building.	(iv)	Support structure antennas shall be placed on premises to minimize visual impacts to adjacent non-industrial properties and adjacent public rights-of-way.&#xA0; Landscaping shall be positioned on the premises to minimize the visual impacts to adjacent non-industrial properties and adjacent public rights-of-way.	(v)	Accessory equipment and associated equipment facilities shall be located either in an interior space in the existing building or in an attached or detached exterior building.&#xA0; Exterior equipment buildings constructed on premises shall be architecturally similar to the existing building or otherwise architecturally integrated.	(vi)	Monopoles shall be of tapered design (e.g., three foot base to 1.5 foot top) with no climbing spikes.&#xA0; Whenever possible, existing light standards in parking lots should be used with antennas above electroliers.	(6)	Landscaping and Maintenance.&#xA0; Landscaping shall be required at the perimeter of the property which abuts streets, residential uses, and in all zones, or areas with access to the public as follows:	(i)	For monopoles, a landscaped buffer area to soften the visual impact shall commence at the property line.&#xA0; At least one row of shrubs shall be spaced not more than three feet apart.&#xA0; Materials shall be of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting.&#xA0; At least one row of trees or shrubs, not less than four feet in height at the time of planting, and spaced not more than 15 feet apart, also shall be provided.&#xA0; Appropriate irrigation and maintenance to sustain any required landscaping shall be required.	(ii)	Pursuant to Section 12.24 W.49. of this Code, the decision-maker may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening, including plantings, fences, walls, sign and structural applications, manufactured devices and other features designed to screen, camouflage and buffer antennas, poles and accessory uses.&#xA0; The antenna and supporting structure or monopole shall be of a design and treated with an architectural material so that it is camouflaged to resemble a tree with a single trunk and branches on its upper part, or shall be designed using other similar stealth techniques.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 177,103, Eff. 12/18/05.)	(7)	Signal Interference.&#xA0; Claims of interference with the operations of any business or residential use due to the operations of the facility shall be subject to correction by the permittee.&#xA0; Any claim shall be reviewed by a qualified, mutually agreeable third party who will test actual site conditions and propose mitigation of any interference determined to be due to the operation of the facility.	(8)	Time Limits.&#xA0; All wireless telecommunication facilities shall be removed within 90 days of discontinuance of use.

(b)	No required yard or other open space around an existing building, or which is hereafter provided around any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this article, shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building, nor shall any yard or any other required open space on an adjoining lot be considered as providing a yard or open space on a lot wherein a building is to be erected or established.	No required yard or other open space around a building shall be located and maintained on property which is in a more restrictive zone than that of the property on which such building is located; except that where a lot is partly in the P zone and partly in a C or M zone, any P zone may be used to meet any yard requirements of the C or M zone, provided the front yard conforms to the requirements of Section 12.21-C,1(g) and all unpaved areas of such yards are suitably landscaped. The relationship between the more restrictive and less restrictive zones shall be determined by the sequence of zones set forth in Section 12.23-B,1(c).&#xA0; (2nd Para., Amended by Ord. No. 151,599, Eff. 11/25/78.)	(c)	Except in the RZ Zone, every main building shall be located and maintained on a &#x201C;lot&#x201D; or &#x201C;air space lot&#x201D; as defined in this article, and all parts of such building shall be connected in a substantial manner by common walls or a continuous roof. In the RZ Zone a main building may be located on not more than five lots. There may not be more than one such building on a lot in the RA, RE, RS, R1, RU, RMP, or RW1 Zones, or on a group of lots in the RZ Zone. (Amended by Ord. No. 164,904, Eff. 7/6/89.)	Provided, however, there may be more than one main residential building on a lot in the RW2 Zone, but there shall be no more than one main residential building for each 2,300 square feet of lot area.	(d)	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,268, Eff. 7/1/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)&#xA0; No building or structure shall be erected or maintained on a lot which abuts a street having only a portion of its required width where no part of the street would normally revert to the lot if vacated, or which lot is separated from the a street by only a future street, unless the yards provided and maintained adjacent to the street in connection with the building or structure have a width or depth, which includes the portion of the lot needed to complete the required width of the street, plus the width or depth of the yards required on the lot by other provisions of this article.&#xA0; Where a future street intervenes between the lot and the street, the yards shall be determined as though the lot abutted directly on the future street.&#xA0; In no case, shall this regulation be applied so as to reduce the buildable width of a corner lot to less than 40 feet.	The City Planning Commission, upon request, shall determine a required street width.&#xA0; The determination shall be based upon the standards for street widths contained in the subdivision regulations of the City, the prevailing widths of streets in the immediate, surrounding area, with due consideration given to any particular topographical or geological conditions or sizes of ownership affecting the property involved.	(e)	On any lot of less than one acre in an &#x201C;RA&#x201D; or &#x201C;R&#x201D; Zone which was of record or held in separate ownership on June 1,1946, or was subsequently created either by the recording of a division of land map or otherwise in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations, the originally required front yard shall be provided and maintained on such lot in addition to any new front yard required by any subsequent rearrangement of the lot lines by sale or division (without recording a subdivision map) creating a new lot fronting on a different street than that on which said original lot fronted.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 140,717, Eff. 8/12/70.)	(f)	No accessory building shall be structurally altered, converted, enlarged or maintained for the purpose of providing living quarters or dwelling units unless such accessory building and all enlargements thereof are made to conform to all the regulations of this article for new buildings.

No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; Every required front, side and rear yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky, except for those projections permitted by Sections 12.08.5, 12.09.5 and 12.22.	No automobile parking space shall be provided or maintained within a required front yard. Except where a lot is developed with a building meeting the requirements of Section 12.08.3B1, not more than 50 percent of a required front yard shall be designed, improved or used for access driveways.	All portions of the required front yard of one-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, multiple dwellings or group dwellings, apartment houses, hotels, motels, apartment hotels and retirement hotels in the RE, RS, R1, RU, RZ, R2, RD, R3, RAS3, R4, RAS4, R5, or C Zones not used for necessary driveways and walkways, including decorative walkways, shall be used for planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.&#xA0; The planted area in the RD, R3, RAS3, R4, RAS4, R5, or C Zones shall be planted in accordance with a landscape plan prepared by a licensed landscape architect, licensed architect, or landscape contractor to the satisfaction of the Department of City Planning.&#xA0; The planted area shall include at least one tree, which shall be at least 15 gallon in size and at least six feet in height at the time of planting, for each 500 square feet of planted area and shall be equipped with an automatic irrigation system, which shall be properly maintained.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 179,191, Eff. 11/5/07.)	A fee pursuant to Section 19.01I shall be paid to the Department of City Planning for the checking of landscape plans, pursuant to this paragraph. However, the fee shall be waived if any other fee has been paid for checking of landscape plans for the same property.	No swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water which is designed or used to contain water 18 inches or more in depth shall be permitted in any required yard space in which fences over 3-1/2 feet in height are prohibited, even though the pool, pond or body of water extends below the adjacent natural ground level.	(h)	At each end of a through lot there shall be a front yard of the depth required by this article for the zone in which each street frontage is located, except that only one front yard need be provided on those through lots which abut on a primary, major or secondary highway, as such highways are shown on the &#x201C;Highways and Freeways Element of the General Plan,&#x201D; when the rights to vehicular ingress and egress from such through lots to the highway have been abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction as a condition precedent to the approval of the recordation of the subdivision in which such through lots are included. Where only one front yard is required on a through lot, as provided herein, the rear yard shall be located on the portion of such lot adjacent to the highway.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 141,821, Eff. 5/24/71.)	Where a through lot is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single building site, and the two required front yards are provided, no rear yard is required.	(i)	No required yard or other open space around an existing building shall be separated in ownership from the portion of the lot upon which the building is located.	(j)	The area of a lot upon which a building or use is located shall not be reduced below the total area required for all of the dwelling units or guest rooms contained in the building or required for the specific use, or required because of the height or total floor area contained in the building, by separating the ownership of a portion of the lot from that upon which the building or use is located.

(a)	(Amended by Ord. No. 151,608, Eff. 11/26/78.)&#xA0; There shall be at least 20 feet of space between every two-story apartment hotel, apartment house, boarding or rooming house, guest house hotel or multiple dwelling, and any other main building on the same lot. Such space may be reduced to 10 feet where the buildings are located on a corner lot and the space opens directly onto the side street.	In the RD zone there shall be at least 20 feet of space between every main building and any other main building on the same lot where either of the buildings contains three or more dwelling units.	In all other cases there shall be at least 10 feet of space between every residential building and another main building on the same lot.	The width of the space herein required shall be increased by two feet for each story over two contained in any building adjoining said space.	Those regulations do not apply to the spaces required between accessory buildings (not designed as residential buildings) and other buildings on the same lot as otherwise provided for in Subdivision 5 of this subsection.	(b)	There shall be a passageway of at least 10 feet in width extending from a street to one entrance of each dwelling unit or guest room in every residential building, except those located in the RW, RU, or RZ Zones, unless there is an entrance to the dwelling unit or guest room opening directly onto a public street or into a hallway opening into a public street or onto a l0-foot passageway extending to a public street. In the RW and RZ Zones, there shall be a passageway at least 4 feet in width, and in the RU Zone, there shall be a passageway at least 3 feet in width, extending from a street, or public right-of-way in the case of the RW Zones, to one entrance of each dwelling unit in every residential building.

Where a one story, one or two-family dwelling has been continuously maintained on the front of a lot since prior to June 1,1946, with a passageway of less than ten feet but not less than eight feet in width from the street to the rear of said dwelling, an additional one or two family dwelling may be erected and maintained on the rear of the lot, provided the passageway is not further reduced. However, this limited passageway shall be permitted where there are to be only two residential buildings on the lot. (Amended by Ord. No. 108,661, Eff. 2/11/57.)	In addition to all other applicable provisions herein, where a building or portion thereof is constructed on or within an air space lot, and such building or portion thereof is used for residential purposes, there shall be a passageway extending from a street to the entrance of such building on the lot which has had the air space above or below it divided by such air space lot or lots. (4th Para. Added by Ord. No. 156,681, Eff. 6/21/82.)	(c)	In computing the width of a passageway where the passageway, adjoins a lot line, the width of any required yard adjoining such lot line may be assumed to be a portion of the required width of the passageway.	(d)	Any space between buildings or any passageway having less width than that required by this subdivision shall be maintained and shall not be further reduced in any manner.	(e)	The passageways and other open spaces required by this subdivision shall be open and unobstructed from ground to sky, except for the projections permitted by the provisions of Section 12.22 C., and except that Solar Structures that provide shade over the habitable area may cover up to 25% of the required open space.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord.

(iii)	In determining the required Front Yard, the following shall not be taken into account:&#xA0; Buildings located on key Lots, entirely on the rear half of Lots, or on Lots in the &#x201C;C&#x201D; or &#x201C;M&#x201D; Zones.	(iv)	Nothing contained in this subparagraph (1) shall, however, be deemed to require Front Yards which exceed 40 feet in depth.	(2)	Front Yard Setback on Lots Fronting on Substandard Hillside Limited Street.&#xA0; For any Lot that fronts on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, there shall be a minimum Front Yard setback of at least five feet.&#xA0; However, the prevailing Front Yard setback regulations, as outlined in Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a), shall apply, so long as a Front Yard setback of no less than five feet is provided.	(3)	Front Yard Setbacks on Key Lots.&#xA0; On Key Lots, the minimum Front Yard may be the average of the required Front Yard for the adjoining Interior Lot and the required Side Yard along the Street side of a Reversed Corner Lot.&#xA0; But such minimum Front Yard may apply for a distance of not more than 85 feet from the rear Lot line of the Reversed Corner Lot, beyond which point the Front Yard specified in Table 12.21 C.10-1 or Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a) shall apply.&#xA0; Where existing Buildings on either or both of said adjoining Lots are located nearer to the front or side Lot lines than the Yard required by this Paragraph (a), the Yards established by such existing buildings may be used in computing the required Front Yard for a Key Lot.	(4)	Front Yard Setbacks on Through Lots.&#xA0; At each end of a Through Lot, there shall be a Front Yard setback as required by this Paragraph (a) for the zone in which each Street Frontage is located.&#xA0; But only one Front Yard need be provided on those Through Lots which abut on a primary, Major or Secondary Highway, as such highways are shown on the &#x201C;Highways and Freeways Element of the General Plan&#x201D;, when the rights to vehicular ingress and egress from such Through Lots to the highways have been abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction.&#xA0; Where only one Front Yard is required on a Through Lot, as provided herein, the Rear Yard shall be located on the portion of such Lot adjacent to the highway.	Where a Through Lot is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single Building site, and the two required Front Yards are provided, no Rear Yard is required.	(5)	Front Yard Paving.&#xA0; All portions of the required Front Yard not used for necessary driveways and walkways, including decorative walkways, shall be used for planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.	(6)	Front Yard on Lots Existing Prior to June 1, 1946.&#xA0; This provision shall apply to any Lot of less than one acre which was of record or held in separate ownership on June 1, 1946, or was subsequently created either by the recording of a division of land map or otherwise in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations.&#xA0; On any such Lot, the originally required Front Yard shall be provided and maintained in addition to any new Front Yard required by any subsequent rearrangement of the Lot lines by sale or division (without recording a subdivision map) creating a new Lot fronting on a different Street than that on which the original Lot fronted.	(7)	Side and Rear Yards for Basements.&#xA0; In determining the required Side and Rear Yards of a Building, any Basement containing Habitable Rooms shall be considered a Story.	(8)	Yards in the Coastal Zone.&#xA0; The following setback requirements shall apply to Lots located in a Coastal Zone:	(i)	On a Lot in the RE9 or RE11 Zone, there shall be a Side Yard on each side of a main Building of not less than 5 feet.&#xA0; Where the Lot is less than 50 feet in width, the Side Yard may be reduced to 10% of the width of the Lot, but in no event less than 3 feet.	(ii)	In lieu of the additional Side Yard requirement in Table 12.21 C.10-1, for a Building more than two-stories in height on Lots in the R1, RS, or RE Zone, one foot shall be added to the width of each required Side Yard for each additional Story above the second Story.	(iii)	On a Lot in the RA Zone, where a Side Yard is less than 10 feet in width, and the Building erected on the Lot is three or more Stories in height, one foot shall be added to such Side Yard.	(9)	Side Yards in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in Subdivision Approvals.&#xA0; Side Yard requirements in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in subdivision approvals shall take precedence over requirements of this Subdivision 10.&#xA0; Otherwise, this Subdivision shall apply.	(10)	Encroachments Into Required Yards.&#xA0; Every required Front, Side and Rear Yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for the following:	(i)	Garages in Front Yards.&#xA0; A Private Garage may be located on the required Front Yard of a Lot where the Elevation of the ground at a point 50 feet from the front Lot line of a Lot and midway between the side Lot lines differs 10 feet or more from the curb level, provided every portion of the garage Building is at least 5 feet from the front Lot line.&#xA0; Where the wall of such garage is two-thirds below natural or finished Grade of the Lot, whichever is lower, said wall may extend to the adjacent side Lot line; in all other cases, said garage shall not be nearer to the side Lot line than the width of the Side Yard required for a main Building of the same height.	(ii)	Open, Unenclosed Stairways, Porches, Platforms, Landing Places, or Balconies.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, on Lots fronting onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, open unenclosed stairways, porches, platforms and landing places not covered by a roof or canopy shall not project or extend into the Front Yard.&#xA0; Balconies with 10 feet or more of vertical clearance beneath them may project or extend no more than 30 inches into a Front Yard.	(iii)	Other Exceptions.&#xA0; All of those exceptions found in Subdivision 5. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 and in Section 12.22 of this Code.	(11)	Pools, Ponds, or Body of Water in Required Yards.&#xA0; No swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water which is designed or used to contain water 18 inches or more in depth shall be permitted in any required Yard Space in which fences over 42 inches in height are prohibited, even though the pool, pond or body of water extends below the adjacent natural ground level.	(12)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.&#xA0; For Lots fronting on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, a Zoning Administrator may grant a reduction of the front Setback requirements of Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph and Side Yard requirements in Table 12.21 C.10-1, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code; however, in no event shall the Side Yard be less than 4 feet.	(b)	Maximum Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; The maximum Residential Floor Area contained in all Buildings and Accessory Buildings shall not exceed the sum of the square footage of each Slope Band multiplied by the corresponding Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for the zone of the Lot, as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-2a.&#xA0; This formula can be found in Table 12.21 C.10-2b, where &#x201C;A&#x201D; is the area of the Lot within each Slope Band, &#x201C;FAR&#x201D; is the FAR of the corresponding Slope Band, and &#x201C;RFA&#x201D; is the sum of the Residential Floor Area of each Slope Band.

	(1)	Slope Analysis Map.&#xA0; As part of an application for a permit to the Department of Building and Safety, or for a Discretionary Approval as defined in Section 16.05 B. of this Code to the Department of City Planning, the applicant shall submit a Slope Analysis Map based on a survey of the natural/existing topography, prepared, stamped, and signed by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, to verify the total area (in square feet) of the portions of a property within each Slope Band identified in Table 12.21 C.10-2a.&#xA0; The Director of Planning, or his/her designee, shall verify that the Slope Analysis Map has been prepared by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor.&#xA0; In addition, the Director of Planning, or his/her designee shall approve the calculated Maximum Residential Floor Area for the Lot by the registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor using the Slope Analysis Map prior to applying for a permit from the Department of Building and Safety.	The map shall have a scale of not less than 1 inch to 100 feet and a contour interval of not more than 10 feet with two-foot intermediates.&#xA0; The map shall also indicate the datum, source, and scale of topographic data used in the Slope analysis, and shall attest to the fact that the Slope analysis has been accurately calculated.	The Slope Analysis Map shall clearly delineate/identify the Slope Bands (i.e. with contrasting colors or hatching), and shall include a tabulation of the total area in square-feet within each Slope Band, as well as the FAR and Residential Floor Area value of each corresponding Slope Band as shown on Table 12.21 C.10-2b.	The Slope Analysis Map shall be prepared using CAD-based, GIS-based, or other type of software specifically designed for such purpose.	(2)	Guaranteed Minimum Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; Notwithstanding the above, the maximum Residential Floor Area for all Buildings and Accessory Buildings on any Lot may be least the percentage of the Lot size as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-3 below or 1,000 square feet, whichever is greater.

	The guaranteed minimum for the original zone as stated in the paragraph above shall apply to Lots that meet the following criteria:&#xA0; have an area that is less than 50% of the minimum Lot size for its Zone, were made nonconforming in Lot size as a result of an adopted zone change or code amendment changing the minimum Lot size, and met the minimum Lot size requirements of the original zone.	(3)	Residential Floor Area Bonus.&#xA0; An additional 20% of the maximum Residential Floor Area as determined by Table 12.21 C.10-2 of this Paragraph (b), or an additional 30% for Lots where the guaranteed minimum outlined in Subparagraph (2) of this Paragraph (b) is utilized, for that Lot shall be allowed if any of the options listed below is utilized.&#xA0; Only one bonus per property is allowed.	(i)	Proportional Stories Option.&#xA0; The total Residential Floor Area of each Story other than the Base Floor in a multi-Story Building does not exceed 75% of the Base Floor Area. This option shall only apply to flat Building pads where the Slope of the Building pad area prior to any Grading, as measured from the highest and lowest Elevation points of the existing Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of the proposed Building or Structure, is less than 15%; or	(ii)	Front Facade Stepback Option.&#xA0; The cumulative length of the exterior walls which are not a part of a garage facing the Front Lot Line, equal to a minimum of 25% of the Building width, shall be stepped-back a distance of at least 20% of the Building depth from a plane parallel to the Lot width established at the point of the Building closest to the Front Lot line.&#xA0; When the Front Lot line is not straight, a line connecting the points where the Side Lot lines and the Front Lot line intersect shall be used to establish the plane parallel to the front Lot width.&#xA0; When Through Lots have, or are required to provide, two Front Yard setbacks, the step-back shall be provided along both Front Lot Lines.&#xA0; When referred by the Department of Building and Safety, for unusual Building and/or Lot configuration, the Director of Planning or his/her designee shall determine that the proposed project complies with this provision and qualifies for a Residential Floor Area bonus.	For the purposes of this provision, all exterior walls that intersect a plane parallel to the Front Lot Line at 45 degrees or less shall be considered to be facing the Front Lot Line.&#xA0; The Building width shall be the greatest distance between the exterior walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot width.&#xA0; The Building depth shall be the greatest distance between the exterior walls of the Building measured parallel to the Lot depth.	This option shall only apply to Structures which are no more than 35 feet from the Frontage along an improved Street and on a &#x201C;flat&#x201D; Building pad where the Slope of the Building pad prior to any Grading, as measured from the highest point of the existing Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior wall of the proposed Building or Structure to the lowest point of the existing natural Grade within 5 horizontal feet, is less than 15%; or	(iii)	Cumulative Side Yard Setbacks Option.&#xA0; The combined width of Side Yards shall be at least 25% of the total Lot Width, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, but in no event shall a single Side Yard setback be less than 10% of the Lot Width or the minimum required by Paragraph (a) of this Subdivision, whichever is greater.&#xA0; One foot shall be added to each required Side Yard for each increment of 10 feet or fraction thereof of height above the first 18 feet of height.&#xA0; The width of a required Side Yard setback shall be maintained for the entire length of a Side Yard and cannot alternate from one Side Yard to the other; or	(iv)	18-Foot Envelope Height Option.&#xA0; For properties which are not in the &#x201C;1SS&#x201D; Single-Story Height District, the maximum envelope height, measured pursuant to Subparagraph (1) of Paragraph (d) of this Subdivision 10., shall be no more than 18 feet; or&#xA0;	(v)	Multiple Structures Option.&#xA0; In addition to the Lot coverage requirements in Paragraph (e) of this Subdivision, any one Building and Structure extending more than 6 feet above Hillside Area Grade, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, shall cover no more than 20% of the area of a Lot.&#xA0; Such Buildings or Structures may only be connected by one breezeway, fully enclosed walkway, elevator, or combination thereof of not more than 5 feet in width; or	(vi)	Minimal Grading Option.&#xA0; For properties where at least 60% of the Lot is comprised of Slopes which are 30% or greater, as determined by a Slope Analysis Map prepared in accordance with Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (b), the total amount of any Grading on the site (including exempted Grading, as outlined in Paragraph (f) of this Subdivision (10)) does not exceed the numeric value of 10% of the total Lot size in cubic yards or 1,000 cubic yards, whichever is less (example:&#xA0; a project involving 500 cubic-yards of Grading on a 5,000 square-foot Lot will be eligible for this bonus option); or	(vii)	Green Building Option.&#xA0; For a new One-Family Dwelling only, the new construction must satisfy the Tier 1 requirements or higher of the LA Green Building Code, as defined in Section 99.01.101.1 of this Code.	(4)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.	(i)	10% Adjustments.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator has the authority to grant adjustments from the requirements of this Paragraph (b) of not more than 10%, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subsection A. of Section 12.28 of this Code.	(ii)	Additions to Structures Existing Prior to August 1, 2010.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator has the authority to approve any additions made after August 1, 2010,&#xA0; to a One-Family Dwelling existing prior to that date for which permits have been previously obtained which exceed the requirements of this Paragraph (b), pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code, provided:	a.	the total cumulative Residential Floor Area of all such additions does not exceed 1,000 square feet; and&#xA0;	b.	the resulting Building does not exceed the height of the original Building or the height permitted in Paragraph (d) of this Subdivision 10. below, whichever is greater; and&#xA0;	c.	at least two off-street covered parking spaces are provided.	(c)	Verification of Existing Residential Floor Area.&#xA0; For additions with cumulative Residential Floor Area of less than 1,000 square feet constructed after August 1, 2010, or remodels of Buildings built prior to August 1, 2010, the existing Residential Floor Area shall be the same as the Building square footage shown on the most recent Los Angeles County Tax Assessor&#x2019;s records at the time the plans are submitted to the Department of Building and Safety and a plan check fee is paid.&#xA0; Except that Residential Floor Area may be calculated as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code when a complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area calculations of all the Structures on the Lot, prepared by a licensed architect or engineer, is submitted by the applicant.	Any work that does not qualify as a remodel, as defined in the paragraph below, or additions that are 1,000 square feet or larger shall require a complete set of fully dimensioned plans with area calculations of all the Structures on the Lot prepared by a licensed architect or engineer.	For the purposes of implementing this Paragraph (c), a remodel shall mean the alteration of an existing Building or Structure provided that at least 50 percent of the perimeter length of the contiguous exterior walls and 50 percent of the roof are retained.	(d)	Height Limits.&#xA0; No portion of a Building or Structure shall be erected or enlarged which exceeds the envelope height limits as outlined in Table 12.21 C.10-4, or as otherwise stated in the paragraphs below.&#xA0; For the provisions below, whenever Grade is mentioned, it shall mean Hillside Area Grade as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code.

	(1)	Measurement of Height.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code, the height limits in Table 12.21 C.10-4 shall be measured as set forth below.	(i)	Maximum Envelope Height.&#xA0; Envelope height (otherwise known as vertical height or &#x201C;plumb line&#x201D; height) shall be the vertical distance from the Grade of the site to a projected plane at the roof Structure or parapet wall located directly above and parallel to the Grade.&#xA0; Measurement of the envelope height shall originate at the lowest Grade within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of a Building or Structure.&#xA0; At no point shall any given section of any part of the proposed Building or Structure exceed the maximum envelope height.	A topographic map shall be submitted as a separate plan sheet or as part of the site plan identifying the 5-foot perimeter of the exterior walls, or any other information which the Department of Building and Safety deems necessary to determine compliance with this Paragraph (i).	(2)	Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s Authority.&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may allow Structures which exceed the maximum envelope height requirements of Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (d); however, the increase in height may not result in a Building or Structure which exceeds an overall height of 45 feet, pursuant to the authority and procedures established in Subdivision 28. of Subsection X. of Section 12.24 of this Code.&#xA0; The overall height shall be measured from the lowest Elevation point within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of a Building or Structure to the highest Elevation point of the roof Structure or parapet wall.	(3)	Prevailing Height.&#xA0; Notwithstanding Table 12.21 C.10-4 of this Paragraph (d), when 40% or more of the existing One-Family Dwellings with Frontage on both sides of the block have Building heights exceeding these limits, the maximum envelope height for any Building on that block may be the average height of the Dwellings exceeding these limits.	(4)	Lots in a Single-Story Height District.&#xA0; As enabled by Section 12.21.1 A.1. of this Code, on Lots in a &#x201C;SS&#x201D; Single Story Height District, shown as &#x201C;1SS&#x201D; on a Zoning Map, no Building or Structure shall be erected or enlarged which exceeds one Story.	Notwithstanding the provision in Section 12.21.1 A.8., in determining the number of Stories, any Basement which is exempt from the Residential Floor Area calculation, as outlined in Section 12.03 of this Code, shall not be considered a Story.	(5)	Lots Fronting on Substandard Hillside Limited Streets.&#xA0; For any Lot fronting onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, as defined in Section 12.03, and subject to the 5-foot Front Yard setback, no portion of a Building or Structure within 20 feet of the Front Lot Line shall exceed 24 feet in height.&#xA0; The 24 foot maximum Building and Structure height shall be measured from the Elevation at the centerline or midpoint of the Street on which the Lot fronts.	(6)	Unenclosed/Uncovered Rooftop Decks and Cantilevered Balconies.&#xA0; Unenclosed/uncovered rooftop decks, cantilevered balconies and &#x201C;visually permeable railing&#x201D; (no more than 42 inches in height), may project beyond the maximum envelope height, as limited and measured in Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (d), no more than 5 horizontal feet.	For the purposes of this Subparagraph (6), &#x201C;visually permeable railing&#x201D; means railing constructed of material that is transparent, such as glass or plastic panels, or wrought iron or other solid material which is 80% open to light and air.	(7)	Roof Structures.&#xA0; Roof Structures as described in Table 12.21 C.10-5 below, or similar Structures, may be erected above the height limit specified in Table 12.21 C.10-4.
