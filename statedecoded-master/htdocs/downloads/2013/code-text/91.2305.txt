as that required for hand-driven nails, including diameter, minimum length and
minimum head diameter.  Clipped head or box nails are not permitted in new

construction may be taken at no more than the nail-head-area ratio of that of
the same size hand-driven nails.91.2305.5. Hold-down Connectors.  In Seismic

shear wall overturning moments using approved cyclic load values or 75 percent
of the allowable seismic load values that do not consider cyclic loading of the
product. Connector bolts into wood framing shall require steel plate washers on
the post on the opposite side of the anchorage device.  Plate size shall be a
minimum of 0.229 inch by 3 inches by 3 inches (5.82 mm by 76 mm by 76 mm) in
