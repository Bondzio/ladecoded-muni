shall open, or allow to remain open, the cover of any maintenance hole in or
upon any street, sidewalk or other right-of-way without having first obtained a
written permit from the Bureau of Engineering, except as provided in Subsection

written request an annual permit to open sewer or storm drain maintenance holes
for the purpose of determining the depth of sewer or storm drains.  Any person
who opens the cover of a maintenance hole pursuant to the authority granted by
such an annual permit shall not have to comply with the provisions of Subsection
(a) of this Section.	(c)	At all times while a maintenance hole cover in or upon
any street, sidewalk or other right-of-way is open pursuant to the provisions of
a permit including, but not limited to the permits identified in Subsections (a)
and (b) of this Section, the original or a certified copy of the permit must be
kept at the open maintenance hole and must, on demand, be shown to any City
inspector, agent, employee or representative, including but not limited to any
