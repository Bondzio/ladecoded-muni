	(h)	Conditions to Issuance of Permit.&#xA0; The Board may condition the issuance of a permit by imposing reasonable requirements concerning the time, place, and manner of the Event, as necessary to protect the safety of all persons and property, provided that the conditions shall not unreasonably restrict the right of free speech.&#xA0; These conditions include, but are not limited to:

	(i)	Grounds for Denial of Application or Revocation of a Permit.

	1.	The Board, through either the Executive Director or the Designated Police Commissioner, shall approve an application for a permit unless it determines from a consideration of the application or other pertinent information, the existence of any of the following, any of which shall also be justification for the Board to revoke a previously issued permit:

	A.	Information contained in the application, or supplementary information requested from the applicant, is false in any material detail;

	B.	The applicant failed to provide a complete application after being notified of the requirement of producing additional information or documents;

	C.	The Event will interfere with another Event, street closure or other activity for which a permit has previously been granted;

	D.	The concentration of persons, animals and/or vehicles at the site of the Event, or at the assembly and disbanding areas, will prevent proper police, fire, ambulance, or other public services to areas contiguous to the Event;

	E.	The time, route or size of the Event will disrupt to an unreasonable extent the safe and expeditious movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street or highway when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion;

	F.	The size or duration of the Event will require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the City that providing the minimum level of police services to other areas of the City is jeopardized.&#xA0; Nothing in this paragraph authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect Event participants from the conduct of others;

	G.	The Event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the affected City streets or highways, or a previously granted encroachment permit;&#xA0;

	H.	The parade will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in five hours or less;

	I.	The length of the parade route exceeds 3 miles from its point of origin to its point of termination; or

	J.	The applicant fails to conduct the Event in accordance with the information contained in the permit application, or any terms and conditions imposed on the issued permit.

	2.	When the grounds for denial of the application for a permit specified in Subdivision (i)1. can be corrected by altering the time, place and/or manner of the Event as authorized by Subsection (h), the Board shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application provided the applicant accepts such conditions for permit issuance.&#xA0; The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modifications of the applicant&#x2019;s proposed Event as are necessary to achieve compliance with this subsection.

	(j)	Appeal Procedure.

	1.	Right to Appeal.&#xA0; The applicant shall have the right to appeal any permit conditions imposed upon an Event or the denial of a permit application.&#xA0; The applicant shall also have the right to appeal the amount of traffic control fees or clean-up deposits imposed pursuant to subsection (l).

	2.	Notice of Appeal.&#xA0; A notice of appeal stating the grounds for the appeal shall be filed with the Board no later than three days after delivery of the notice of the denial of the application or notice of the contested/disputed permit conditions.

	3.	Hearing by the Board.

	A.	If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the Board shall conduct a hearing on the appeal at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.&#xA0; The Board shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a continuance.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.

	B.	If the date of the next scheduled meeting of the Board following the receipt of a notice of appeal is later than two business days before the date of the scheduled Event, the Board shall convene a special meeting within 24 hours of the delivery of the notice of appeal.&#xA0; Notice of the time and place of said special meeting shall be given to all parties at least 24 hours prior to said hearing.&#xA0; The Board shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a continuance.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.

	C.	No Board member who did not hear the evidence or who was not read or heard the record or proceedings shall vote on the decision.

	12.	All conditions imposed upon the Event pursuant to Subsection (h) of this Section.

	 (l)	Fees and Indemnification.

	1.	Each applicant, and any other person, organization, firm or corporation on whose behalf the application is made, shall be required to agree in writing to jointly and separately indemnify, protect and defend and hold harmless the City of Los Angeles, its officers and employees against all claims, damages, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of the permittee, its officers, agents or employees in connection with the Parade or Assembly.

	A.	Prepayment of Costs.&#xA0; Upon approval by the Board of a permit for a Parade or Assembly but prior to the date of the scheduled Event, the Department of Transportation, through the Bureau of Street Services, shall provide the applicant with a statement of the estimated cost of providing traffic management at the Event.&#xA0; The applicant/sponsor shall be required to pay the traffic control costs either prior to the date of the Event or within 15 days thereafter.&#xA0; Traffic control consists of clearing the parade/assembly route of unauthorized vehicles, posting any parking restrictions necessary for the Event, diverting traffic around the Event, and directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic along the route of a parade.

	B.	Computing Traffic Control Costs.&#xA0; The traffic control costs shall be computed by determining the number of LADOT personnel who will be required for traffic control beyond that which would otherwise be required at that time, multiplied by the number of hours for which such additional service is rendered at the rate of the City&#x2019;s full cost of providing officers on an hourly basis as established by the Department of Transportation.

	C.	Refunds or Additional Charges.&#xA0; If the actual cost for traffic control on the date of the Event is less than the estimated cost pursuant to Subdivision (l)2.A. above, the applicant/ sponsor will be refunded the difference by the City.&#xA0; If more traffic officers&#x2019; hours are required than originally charged, the applicant/sponsor will be billed the additional costs.

	D.	Traffic control costs shall not be assessed if the size of the parade/assembly can be controlled by 5 or fewer traffic officers over a two-hour period, as determined by LADOT.

	3.	Clean-up Deposit.

	A.	The applicant/sponsor of an Event involving horses or other large animals, the sale of food or beverages, or the erection of any structure shall be required to provide a clean-up deposit prior to the date of the Event, paid to the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Services.&#xA0; The clean-up deposit shall be in the amount established in a cleanup fee schedule adopted by the City Council.

	B.	The clean-up deposit shall be returned after the Event if the area used for the Event has been cleaned and restored to the same condition as existed prior to the Event, as determined by a representative of the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Services.

	C.	If the property used for the Event has not been cleaned or restored, the permittee shall be billed for the actual cost of the clean-up and restoration by the Office of Finance, and the clean-up deposit or portion thereof shall be applied toward the payment of the bill.

	D.	If the permittee disputes the bill, he or she may appeal to the Board of Public Works within 5 days after receipt of the bill.&#xA0; Should there be any unexpended balance on the deposit after completion of the work, this balance shall be promptly refunded to the permittee.&#xA0; Should the amount of the bill exceed the clean-up deposit, the difference shall become due and payable to the City upon the applicant&#x2019;s receipt of the bill.

	4.	Waiver of Fees for Traffic Control and Clean-up Services.&#xA0; Upon receipt of an application therefor to the Bureau of Street Services One Stop Special Events Permit Office, Traffic Control and Clean-up Services costs shall be waived for non-commercial Parades and Assemblies, so long as the particular event would qualify for a waiver applying all of the requirements, conditions and criteria set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.&#xA0; Applications for such waivers shall be processed as set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.

	(m)	Waiver.&#xA0; Except as specifically set forth herein, no requirements of this Section shall be waived.

	(n)	Violation.&#xA0; Willful violation of any of the provisions of this Section, or the terms or conditions of an Event permit by the permittee or any participant in said Event is a misdemeanor.

	(o)	Severability.&#xA0; If any subsection, subdivision. sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this section, or the application thereof to any person, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Section or its application to other persons.&#xA0; The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted this section and each subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions, or the application thereof to any person, be declared invalid or unconstitutional.</full_text><order_by>111</order_by><ancestry><unit id="33" label="article"><name>Police Permit Regulation</name><identifier>3</identifier><url>/10/3/</url></unit><unit id="29" label="chapter"><name>Business Regulations</name><identifier>10</identifier><url>/10/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="1971"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.00</section_number><catch_line>Scope.</catch_line><url>/103.00/</url><token>103.00</token></unit><unit id="2728"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.01</section_number><catch_line>Definitions.</catch_line><url>/103.01/</url><token>103.01</token></unit><unit id="3947"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.02</section_number><catch_line>Permit Required.</catch_line><url>/103.02/</url><token>103.02</token></unit><unit id="1237"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.02.1</section_number><catch_line>Permit Applications.</catch_line><url>/103.02.1/</url><token>103.02.1</token></unit><unit id="3529"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.03</section_number><catch_line>Public Hearings.</catch_line><url>/103.03/</url><token>103.03</token></unit><unit id="1633"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.04</section_number><catch_line>False Statements.</catch_line><url>/103.04/</url><token>103.04</token></unit><unit id="3757"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.05</section_number><catch_line>Overlapping Business.</catch_line><url>/103.05/</url><token>103.05</token></unit><unit id="3124"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.06</section_number><catch_line>Permits &#x2013;

restrict the right of free speech.&#xA0; These conditions include, but are not

Permit.	1.	The Board, through either the Executive Director or the Designated

determines from a consideration of the application or other pertinent
information, the existence of any of the following, any of which shall also be
justification for the Board to revoke a previously issued permit:	A.	Information
contained in the application, or supplementary information requested from the
applicant, is false in any material detail;	B.	The applicant failed to provide a
complete application after being notified of the requirement of producing
additional information or documents;	C.	The Event will interfere with another
Event, street closure or other activity for which a permit has previously been
granted;	D.	The concentration of persons, animals and/or vehicles at the site of
the Event, or at the assembly and disbanding areas, will prevent proper police,
fire, ambulance, or other public services to areas contiguous to the
Event;	E.	The time, route or size of the Event will disrupt to an unreasonable
extent the safe and expeditious movement of traffic contiguous to the event site
or route, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street or highway when it is
usually subject to great traffic congestion;	F.	The size or duration of the
Event will require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the
City that providing the minimum level of police services to other areas of the
City is jeopardized.&#xA0; Nothing in this paragraph authorizes denial of a permit
because of the need to protect Event participants from the conduct of
others;	G.	The Event will substantially interfere with any construction or
maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the affected City streets
or highways, or a previously granted encroachment permit;&#xA0;	H.	The parade will
not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in five hours or
less;	I.	The length of the parade route exceeds 3 miles from its point of origin
to its point of termination; or	J.	The applicant fails to conduct the Event in
accordance with the information contained in the permit application, or any
terms and conditions imposed on the issued permit.	2.	When the grounds for
denial of the application for a permit specified in Subdivision (i)1. can be
corrected by altering the time, place and/or manner of the Event as authorized
by Subsection (h), the Board shall, instead of denying the application,
conditionally approve the application provided the applicant accepts such
conditions for permit issuance.&#xA0; The conditions imposed shall provide for only
such modifications of the applicant&#x2019;s proposed Event as are necessary to
achieve compliance with this subsection.	(j)	Appeal Procedure.	1.	Right to
Appeal.&#xA0; The applicant shall have the right to appeal any permit conditions
imposed upon an Event or the denial of a permit application.&#xA0; The applicant
shall also have the right to appeal the amount of traffic control fees or
clean-up deposits imposed pursuant to subsection (l).	2.	Notice of Appeal.&#xA0; A
notice of appeal stating the grounds for the appeal shall be filed with the
Board no later than three days after delivery of the notice of the denial of the
application or notice of the contested/disputed permit conditions.	3.	Hearing by
the Board.	A.	If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the Board shall conduct
a hearing on the appeal at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.&#xA0; The Board
shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor
agrees to a continuance.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.	B.	If the date of
the next scheduled meeting of the Board following the receipt of a notice of
appeal is later than two business days before the date of the scheduled Event,
the Board shall convene a special meeting within 24 hours of the delivery of the
notice of appeal.&#xA0; Notice of the time and place of said special meeting shall
be given to all parties at least 24 hours prior to said hearing.&#xA0; The Board
shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor
agrees to a continuance.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.	C.	No Board
member who did not hear the evidence or who was not read or heard the record or
proceedings shall vote on the decision.	(k)	Contents of Permit.&#xA0; In each
permit, the Board shall prescribe:	1.	The assembly area and time
therefor:	2.	The start time;	3.	The minimum and maximum speeds for the
Parade;	4.	The exact route of the Parade;	5.	What portions of streets to be
traversed may be occupied by the Event;	6.	The maximum number of units and the
maximum and minimum interval of space to be maintained between the units of the

thereof;	8.	The disbanding area and disbanding time;	9.	The number of persons
required to officiate and/or monitor the Event;	10.	The number and type of
vehicles, if any;	11.	The material and maximum size of any sign, banner, placard
or carrying device therefor; and	12.	All conditions imposed upon the Event
pursuant to Subsection (h) of this Section.	 (l)	Fees and
Indemnification.	1.	Each applicant, and any other person, organization, firm or
corporation on whose behalf the application is made, shall be required to agree
in writing to jointly and separately indemnify, protect and defend and hold
harmless the City of Los Angeles, its officers and employees against all claims,
damages, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising
out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of the permittee, its
officers, agents or employees in connection with the Parade or
Assembly.	2.	Traffic Control Costs.	A.	Prepayment of Costs.&#xA0; Upon approval by
the Board of a permit for a Parade or Assembly but prior to the date of the
scheduled Event, the Department of Transportation, through the Bureau of Street
Services, shall provide the applicant with a statement of the estimated cost of
providing traffic management at the Event.&#xA0; The applicant/sponsor shall be
required to pay the traffic control costs either prior to the date of the Event
or within 15 days thereafter.&#xA0; Traffic control consists of clearing the
parade/assembly route of unauthorized vehicles, posting any parking restrictions
necessary for the Event, diverting traffic around the Event, and directing
pedestrian and vehicular traffic along the route of a parade.	B.	Computing
Traffic Control Costs.&#xA0; The traffic control costs shall be computed by
determining the number of LADOT personnel who will be required for traffic
control beyond that which would otherwise be required at that time, multiplied
by the number of hours for which such additional service is rendered at the rate
of the City&#x2019;s full cost of providing officers on an hourly basis as
established by the Department of Transportation.	C.	Refunds or Additional
Charges.&#xA0; If the actual cost for traffic control on the date of the Event is
less than the estimated cost pursuant to Subdivision (l)2.A. above, the
applicant/ sponsor will be refunded the difference by the City.&#xA0; If more
traffic officers&#x2019; hours are required than originally charged, the
applicant/sponsor will be billed the additional costs.	D.	Traffic control costs
shall not be assessed if the size of the parade/assembly can be controlled by 5
or fewer traffic officers over a two-hour period, as determined by
LADOT.	3.	Clean-up Deposit.	A.	The applicant/sponsor of an Event involving
horses or other large animals, the sale of food or beverages, or the erection of
any structure shall be required to provide a clean-up deposit prior to the date
of the Event, paid to the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street
Services.&#xA0; The clean-up deposit shall be in the amount established in a cleanup
fee schedule adopted by the City Council.	B.	The clean-up deposit shall be
returned after the Event if the area used for the Event has been cleaned and
restored to the same condition as existed prior to the Event, as determined by a
representative of the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street
Services.	C.	If the property used for the Event has not been cleaned or
restored, the permittee shall be billed for the actual cost of the clean-up and
restoration by the Office of Finance, and the clean-up deposit or portion
thereof shall be applied toward the payment of the bill.	D.	If the permittee
disputes the bill, he or she may appeal to the Board of Public Works within 5
days after receipt of the bill.&#xA0; Should there be any unexpended balance on the
deposit after completion of the work, this balance shall be promptly refunded to
the permittee.&#xA0; Should the amount of the bill exceed the clean-up deposit, the
difference shall become due and payable to the City upon the applicant&#x2019;s
receipt of the bill.	4.	Waiver of Fees for Traffic Control and Clean-up
Services.&#xA0; Upon receipt of an application therefor to the Bureau of Street
Services One Stop Special Events Permit Office, Traffic Control and Clean-up
Services costs shall be waived for non-commercial Parades and Assemblies, so
long as the particular event would qualify for a waiver applying all of the
requirements, conditions and criteria set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20
and 41.20.1.&#xA0; Applications for such waivers shall be processed as set forth in
Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.	(m)	Waiver.&#xA0; Except as specifically
set forth herein, no requirements of this Section shall be
waived.	(n)	Violation.&#xA0; Willful violation of any of the provisions of this
Section, or the terms or conditions of an Event permit by the permittee or any
participant in said Event is a misdemeanor.	(o)	Severability.&#xA0; If any
subsection, subdivision. sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this section,
or the application thereof to any person, is for any reason held to be invalid
or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such
decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Section
or its application to other persons.&#xA0; The City Council hereby declares that it
would have adopted this section and each subsection, subdivision, sentence,
clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more
subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions, or the
application thereof to any person, be declared invalid or unconstitutional.

The Board, through either the Executive Director or the Designated Police Commissioner, shall approve an application for a permit unless it determines from a consideration of the application or other pertinent information, the existence of any of the following, any of which shall also be justification for the Board to revoke a previously issued permit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	A.

The concentration of persons, animals and/or vehicles at the site of the Event, or at the assembly and disbanding areas, will prevent proper police, fire, ambulance, or other public services to areas contiguous to the Event;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	E.	The time, route or size of the Event will disrupt to an unreasonable extent the safe and expeditious movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street or highway when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	F.	The size or duration of the Event will require the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;diversion&lt;/span&gt; of so great a number of police officers of the City that providing the minimum level of police services to other areas of the City is jeopardized.&#xA0; Nothing in this paragraph authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect Event participants from the conduct of others;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	G.	The Event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the affected City streets or highways, or a previously granted encroachment permit;&#xA0;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	H.	The parade will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in five hours or less;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	I.	The length of the parade route exceeds 3 miles from its point of origin to its point of termination; or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	J.	The applicant fails to conduct the Event in accordance with the information contained in the permit application, or any terms and conditions imposed on the issued permit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	When the grounds for denial of the application for a permit specified in Subdivision (i)1. can be corrected by altering the time, place and/or manner of the Event as authorized by Subsection (h), the Board shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application provided the applicant accepts such conditions for permit issuance.&#xA0; The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modifications of the applicant&#x2019;s proposed Event as are necessary to achieve compliance with this subsection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(j)	Appeal Procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.	Right to Appeal.&#xA0; The applicant shall have the right to appeal any permit conditions imposed upon an Event or the denial of a permit application.&#xA0; The applicant shall also have the right to appeal the amount of traffic control fees or clean-up deposits imposed pursuant to subsection (l).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Notice of Appeal&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; A &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;notice of appeal&lt;/span&gt; stating the grounds for the appeal shall be filed with the Board no later than three days after delivery of the notice of the denial of the application or notice of the contested/disputed permit conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Hearing&lt;/span&gt; by the Board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	A.	If an applicant files a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;notice of appeal&lt;/span&gt;, the Board shall conduct a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; on the appeal at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.&#xA0; The Board shall render its decision at the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;continuance&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	B.	If the date of the next scheduled meeting of the Board following the receipt of a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;notice of appeal&lt;/span&gt; is later than two business days before the date of the scheduled Event, the Board shall convene a special meeting within 24 hours of the delivery of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;notice of appeal&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; Notice of the time and place of said special meeting shall be given to all parties at least 24 hours prior to said &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; The Board shall render its decision at the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;continuance&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	C.	No Board member who did not hear the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt; or who was not read or heard the record or proceedings shall vote on the decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(k)	Contents of Permit.&#xA0; In each permit, the Board shall prescribe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.

The maximum length of the Parade in miles or fractions thereof;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	8.	The disbanding area and disbanding time;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	9.	The number of persons required to officiate and/or monitor the Event;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	10.	The number and type of vehicles, if any;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	11.	The &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;material&lt;/span&gt; and maximum size of any sign, banner, placard or carrying device therefor; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	12.	All conditions imposed upon the Event pursuant to Subsection (h) of this Section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	 (l)	Fees and Indemnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.	Each applicant, and any other person, organization, firm or corporation on whose behalf the application is made, shall be required to agree in writing to jointly and separately indemnify, protect and defend and hold harmless the City of Los Angeles, its officers and employees against all claims, &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;damages&lt;/span&gt;, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of the permittee, its officers, agents or employees in connection with the Parade or Assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	Traffic Control Costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	A.	Prepayment of Costs.&#xA0; Upon approval by the Board of a permit for a Parade or Assembly but prior to the date of the scheduled Event, the Department of Transportation, through the Bureau of Street Services, shall provide the applicant with a statement of the estimated cost of providing traffic management at the Event.&#xA0; The applicant/sponsor shall be required to pay the traffic control costs either prior to the date of the Event or within 15 days thereafter.&#xA0; Traffic control consists of clearing the parade/assembly route of unauthorized vehicles, posting any parking restrictions necessary for the Event, diverting traffic around the Event, and directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic along the route of a parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	B.	Computing Traffic Control Costs.&#xA0; The traffic control costs shall be computed by determining the number of LADOT personnel who will be required for traffic control beyond that which would otherwise be required at that time, multiplied by the number of hours for which such additional service is rendered at the rate of the City&#x2019;s full cost of providing officers on an hourly basis as established by the Department of Transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	C.	Refunds or Additional Charges.&#xA0; If the actual cost for traffic control on the date of the Event is less than the estimated cost pursuant to Subdivision (l)2.A. above, the applicant/ sponsor will be refunded the difference by the City.&#xA0; If more traffic officers&#x2019; hours are required than originally charged, the applicant/sponsor will be billed the additional costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	D.	Traffic control costs shall not be assessed if the size of the parade/assembly can be controlled by 5 or fewer traffic officers over a two-hour period, as determined by LADOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	Clean-up Deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	A.	The applicant/sponsor of an Event involving horses or other large animals, the sale of food or beverages, or the erection of any structure shall be required to provide a clean-up deposit prior to the date of the Event, paid to the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Services.&#xA0; The clean-up deposit shall be in the amount established in a cleanup fee schedule adopted by the City Council.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	B.

If the property used for the Event has not been cleaned or restored, the permittee shall be billed for the actual cost of the clean-up and restoration by the Office of Finance, and the clean-up deposit or portion thereof shall be applied toward the payment of the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	D.	If the permittee disputes the bill, he or she may appeal to the Board of Public Works within 5 days after receipt of the bill.&#xA0; Should there be any unexpended balance on the deposit after completion of the work, this balance shall be promptly refunded to the permittee.&#xA0; Should the amount of the bill exceed the clean-up deposit, the difference shall become due and payable to the City upon the applicant&#x2019;s receipt of the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	4.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Waiver&lt;/span&gt; of Fees for Traffic Control and Clean-up Services.&#xA0; Upon receipt of an application therefor to the Bureau of Street Services One Stop Special Events Permit Office, Traffic Control and Clean-up Services costs shall be waived for non-commercial Parades and Assemblies, so long as the particular event would qualify for a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;waiver&lt;/span&gt; applying all of the requirements, conditions and criteria set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.&#xA0; Applications for such &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;waivers&lt;/span&gt; shall be processed as set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(m)	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Waiver&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; Except as specifically set forth herein, no requirements of this Section shall be waived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(n)	Violation.&#xA0; Willful violation of any of the provisions of this Section, or the terms or conditions of an Event permit by the permittee or any participant in said Event is a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;misdemeanor&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(o)	Severability.&#xA0; If any subsection, subdivision. sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this section, or the application thereof to any person, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;court&lt;/span&gt; of competent &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt;, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Section or its application to other persons.&#xA0; The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted this section and each subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt; that any one or more subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions, or the application thereof to any person, be declared invalid or unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</html><previous_section id="1084"><structure_id>33</structure_id><section_number>103.109</section_number><catch_line>Motion Picture Shows.</catch_line><url>/103.109/</url><token>103.109</token></previous_section><text><unit id="94" prefix=""><text>&#xA0; PARADES AND ASSEMBLIES.

Alteration of the location of the Assembly, route of the Parade, and/or the area and manner of assembling and disbanding of the Parade;	3.	Accommodation of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including restricting the Event to only a portion of a street or highway;	4.	Compliance with all ordinances or laws and obtaining all legally required permits or licenses;	5.	Requirements for the training and use of volunteers, monitors, or parade officials;	6.	Restrictions on the number and type of vehicles, animals, or structures at the Event, and prior inspection and approval of floats, structures, and decorated vehicles for fire safety by the Los Angeles Fire Department;	7.	Requirements for the use of garbage containers, cleanup, and restoration of City property;	8.	Requirements for providing notice of permit conditions to volunteers, monitors, parade officials, and event participants;	9.

Requirements for the provision of adequate first aid and sanitary facilities;	11.	Requirements for the use of amplification devices or amplified sound; and	12.	Requirements to provide proof of automobile insurance (where the Event involves the operating of vehicles, including motorized floats, upon the streets or highways).	(i)	Grounds for Denial of Application or Revocation of a Permit.	1.	The Board, through either the Executive Director or the Designated Police Commissioner, shall approve an application for a permit unless it determines from a consideration of the application or other pertinent information, the existence of any of the following, any of which shall also be justification for the Board to revoke a previously issued permit:	A.	Information contained in the application, or supplementary information requested from the applicant, is false in any material detail;	B.	The applicant failed to provide a complete application after being notified of the requirement of producing additional information or documents;	C.	The Event will interfere with another Event, street closure or other activity for which a permit has previously been granted;	D.	The concentration of persons, animals and/or vehicles at the site of the Event, or at the assembly and disbanding areas, will prevent proper police, fire, ambulance, or other public services to areas contiguous to the Event;	E.	The time, route or size of the Event will disrupt to an unreasonable extent the safe and expeditious movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street or highway when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion;	F.	The size or duration of the Event will require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the City that providing the minimum level of police services to other areas of the City is jeopardized.&#xA0; Nothing in this paragraph authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect Event participants from the conduct of others;	G.	The Event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the affected City streets or highways, or a previously granted encroachment permit;&#xA0;	H.	The parade will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in five hours or less;	I.	The length of the parade route exceeds 3 miles from its point of origin to its point of termination; or	J.	The applicant fails to conduct the Event in accordance with the information contained in the permit application, or any terms and conditions imposed on the issued permit.	2.	When the grounds for denial of the application for a permit specified in Subdivision (i)1. can be corrected by altering the time, place and/or manner of the Event as authorized by Subsection (h), the Board shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application provided the applicant accepts such conditions for permit issuance.&#xA0; The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modifications of the applicant&#x2019;s proposed Event as are necessary to achieve compliance with this subsection.	(j)	Appeal Procedure.	1.	Right to Appeal.&#xA0; The applicant shall have the right to appeal any permit conditions imposed upon an Event or the denial of a permit application.&#xA0; The applicant shall also have the right to appeal the amount of traffic control fees or clean-up deposits imposed pursuant to subsection (l).	2.	Notice of Appeal.&#xA0; A notice of appeal stating the grounds for the appeal shall be filed with the Board no later than three days after delivery of the notice of the denial of the application or notice of the contested/disputed permit conditions.	3.	Hearing by the Board.	A.	If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the Board shall conduct a hearing on the appeal at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.&#xA0; The Board shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a continuance.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.	B.	If the date of the next scheduled meeting of the Board following the receipt of a notice of appeal is later than two business days before the date of the scheduled Event, the Board shall convene a special meeting within 24 hours of the delivery of the notice of appeal.&#xA0; Notice of the time and place of said special meeting shall be given to all parties at least 24 hours prior to said hearing.&#xA0; The Board shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a continuance.&#xA0; The decision of the Board is final.	C.	No Board member who did not hear the evidence or who was not read or heard the record or proceedings shall vote on the decision.

The exact route of the Parade;	5.	What portions of streets to be traversed may be occupied by the Event;	6.	The maximum number of units and the maximum and minimum interval of space to be maintained between the units of the Parade;	7.	The maximum length of the Parade in miles or fractions thereof;	8.	The disbanding area and disbanding time;	9.	The number of persons required to officiate and/or monitor the Event;	10.	The number and type of vehicles, if any;	11.	The material and maximum size of any sign, banner, placard or carrying device therefor; and	12.	All conditions imposed upon the Event pursuant to Subsection (h) of this Section.	 (l)	Fees and Indemnification.	1.	Each applicant, and any other person, organization, firm or corporation on whose behalf the application is made, shall be required to agree in writing to jointly and separately indemnify, protect and defend and hold harmless the City of Los Angeles, its officers and employees against all claims, damages, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of the permittee, its officers, agents or employees in connection with the Parade or Assembly.	2.	Traffic Control Costs.	A.	Prepayment of Costs.&#xA0; Upon approval by the Board of a permit for a Parade or Assembly but prior to the date of the scheduled Event, the Department of Transportation, through the Bureau of Street Services, shall provide the applicant with a statement of the estimated cost of providing traffic management at the Event.&#xA0; The applicant/sponsor shall be required to pay the traffic control costs either prior to the date of the Event or within 15 days thereafter.&#xA0; Traffic control consists of clearing the parade/assembly route of unauthorized vehicles, posting any parking restrictions necessary for the Event, diverting traffic around the Event, and directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic along the route of a parade.	B.	Computing Traffic Control Costs.&#xA0; The traffic control costs shall be computed by determining the number of LADOT personnel who will be required for traffic control beyond that which would otherwise be required at that time, multiplied by the number of hours for which such additional service is rendered at the rate of the City&#x2019;s full cost of providing officers on an hourly basis as established by the Department of Transportation.	C.	Refunds or Additional Charges.&#xA0; If the actual cost for traffic control on the date of the Event is less than the estimated cost pursuant to Subdivision (l)2.A. above, the applicant/ sponsor will be refunded the difference by the City.&#xA0; If more traffic officers&#x2019; hours are required than originally charged, the applicant/sponsor will be billed the additional costs.	D.	Traffic control costs shall not be assessed if the size of the parade/assembly can be controlled by 5 or fewer traffic officers over a two-hour period, as determined by LADOT.	3.	Clean-up Deposit.	A.	The applicant/sponsor of an Event involving horses or other large animals, the sale of food or beverages, or the erection of any structure shall be required to provide a clean-up deposit prior to the date of the Event, paid to the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Services.&#xA0; The clean-up deposit shall be in the amount established in a cleanup fee schedule adopted by the City Council.	B.	The clean-up deposit shall be returned after the Event if the area used for the Event has been cleaned and restored to the same condition as existed prior to the Event, as determined by a representative of the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Services.	C.	If the property used for the Event has not been cleaned or restored, the permittee shall be billed for the actual cost of the clean-up and restoration by the Office of Finance, and the clean-up deposit or portion thereof shall be applied toward the payment of the bill.	D.	If the permittee disputes the bill, he or she may appeal to the Board of Public Works within 5 days after receipt of the bill.&#xA0; Should there be any unexpended balance on the deposit after completion of the work, this balance shall be promptly refunded to the permittee.&#xA0; Should the amount of the bill exceed the clean-up deposit, the difference shall become due and payable to the City upon the applicant&#x2019;s receipt of the bill.	4.	Waiver of Fees for Traffic Control and Clean-up Services.&#xA0; Upon receipt of an application therefor to the Bureau of Street Services One Stop Special Events Permit Office, Traffic Control and Clean-up Services costs shall be waived for non-commercial Parades and Assemblies, so long as the particular event would qualify for a waiver applying all of the requirements, conditions and criteria set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.&#xA0; Applications for such waivers shall be processed as set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.	(m)	Waiver.&#xA0; Except as specifically set forth herein, no requirements of this Section shall be waived.	(n)	Violation.&#xA0; Willful violation of any of the provisions of this Section, or the terms or conditions of an Event permit by the permittee or any participant in said Event is a misdemeanor.	(o)	Severability.&#xA0; If any subsection, subdivision. sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this section, or the application thereof to any person, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Section or its application to other persons.&#xA0; The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted this section and each subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions, or the application thereof to any person, be declared invalid or unconstitutional.</text><type>section</type><prefixes><unit></unit></prefixes><entire_prefix></entire_prefix><prefix_anchor></prefix_anchor><level>1</level></unit></text></law>
