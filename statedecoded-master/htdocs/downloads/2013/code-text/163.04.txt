WHEN RELOCATION BENEFITS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID. (§ 163.04)

  WHEN RELOCATION BENEFITS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID.	A.	The relocation benefits
required by this article shall be paid by the landlord to the tenant within ten
days after the date that the order to vacate is first mailed to the owner and
posted on the premises, or at least 20 days prior to the vacation date set forth
in the order to vacate, whichever occurs later.	B.	If there are fewer than ten
days between the first posting and mailing of the order to vacate and the
vacation date, the relocation benefits shall be paid by the landlord to the
tenant within 24 hours after the notice is posted and mailed.  The Enforcement
Agency shall provide either telephonic or written notice to the landlord to
notify the landlord that the benefits are payable immediately.  Failure to
provide notice as specified in this section shall not relieve the landlord of
any obligations imposed by this article.	C.	If a tenant is entitled to
relocation benefits pursuant to Section 163.02 above, the Enforcement Agency
shall provide either telephonic or written notice to the tenant of his or her
entitlement to the benefits.  Written notice may be satisfied by posting a
written notice on the premises stating that tenants may be entitled to
relocation benefits.
