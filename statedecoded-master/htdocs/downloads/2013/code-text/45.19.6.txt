PURPOSES AND INTENT. (§ 45.19.6)

  PURPOSES AND INTENT.
	(Article and Section Added by Ord. No. 181,069, Eff. 3/14/10*.)

*Note: See Sec. 3 of this ordinance, as clarified by Sec. 10 of Ord. No.
181,157, regarding the effective date.

	It is the purpose and intent of this article to regulate the collective
cultivation of medical marijuana in order to ensure the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the City of Los Angeles.  The regulations in this
article, in compliance with the Compassionate Use Act, the Medical Marijuana
Program Act, and the California Health and Safety Code (collectively referred to
as “State Law”) do not interfere with a patient’s right to use medical
marijuana as authorized under State Law, nor do they criminalize the possession
or cultivation of medical marijuana by specifically defined classifications of
persons, as authorized under State Law.  Under State Law, only qualified
patients, persons with identification cards, and primary caregivers may
cultivate medical marijuana collectively.  Medical marijuana collectives shall
comply with all provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (“Code”), State
Law, and all other applicable local and state laws.  Nothing in this article
purports to permit activities that are otherwise illegal under state or local
law.
