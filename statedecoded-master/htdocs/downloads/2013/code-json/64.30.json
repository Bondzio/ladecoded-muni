applicable.\u00a0 In addition, such dischargers shall notify the Director in accordance with Paragraph (e) of this Subdivision after the discharger has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month.\n\n\t(2)\tAll other dischargers subject to NCPS expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of production) shall include information on the actual production during the sampling period in its Report on Compliance and its Periodic Compliance Reports, as applicable.\n\n\t(e)\tNotification of Changed Discharge.\n\n\t(1)\tAll industrial dischargers shall provide written notification to the Director before any planned change, including physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility, production increases and anticipated process changes which will result in a substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants to be discharged, including notification of changes in the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the discharger has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR \u00a7403.12(p).\u00a0 Notice shall be provided at least ninety (90) days before the change, except if such notice is not feasible, the discharger shall provide the Director notice as soon as the information becomes available.\n\n\t(2)\tNo wastewater discharge shall be commenced, without notification to and approval by the Director, in which there has been a substantial change in the volume or characteristic which causes it to be different from that expressly allowed under the permit issued.\u00a0 Upon such notification, the Director, in his\/her discretion, may require that a new application be filed and a new permit obtained before any wastewater discharge involving the changed characteristic takes place.\n\n\t(f)\tSignatory\/Certification for Baseline Monitoring Reports, Reports on Compliance, and Periodic Compliance Reports.\u00a0 Baseline Monitoring Reports, Reports on Compliance and Periodic Compliance Reports submitted by dischargers subject to NCPS shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger and shall contain the following certification:\n\n\tI certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.\u00a0 Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.\u00a0 I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.\n\n\t(g)\tSignatory\/Certification for Other Reports.\u00a0 The Director, at his\/her discretion, may require other reports or information submitted by dischargers subject to NCPS, or any other discharger, to meet signatory\/certification requirements as the Director deems appropriate.\n\n\t(h)\tAdoption of New City Specific Pollutant Limitations.\u00a0 Within 180 days after promulgation of a new City Specific Pollutant Limitation and notification thereof by the Board to specific dischargers affected thereby, any discharger subject to such limitations shall submit to the Director a report containing:\n\n\t(1)\tThe name and address of the discharger;\n\n\t(2)\tThe address or location of the premises where the discharge does or will take place;\n\n\t(3)\tThe nature, average production rate, and Standard Industrial Classification of the operations carried out by the discharger;\n\n\t(4)\tThe average and maximum flow of the discharge in gallons per day;\n\n\t(5)\tThe nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process and identification of applicable limitations. The concentration shall be reported as a maximum or average as provided in applicable limitations. If equivalent concentration limits have been calculated in accordance with the limitation, this adjusted concentration limit shall also be submitted;\n\n\t(6)\tA statement, reviewed by an authorized representative and certified under penalty of perjury by a person with primary responsibility for the operation which contributes to the discharge, indicating whether the limitations are being met, and, if not, what operation and maintenance improvements or additional pretreatment is required for compliance;\n\n\t(7)\tThe shortest schedule under which any additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance improvements required as a result of the new limitations or requirements imposed pursuant to Paragraph (a) of Subdivision 1 of Subsection C of this section will be completed.\n\n\t(i)\tThe completion date in such a schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable limitation.\n\n\t(ii)\tThe schedule shall provide for reporting increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of any additional pretreatment necessary (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, completing construction).\n\n\t(iii)\tThe discharger shall also submit a written progress report to the Director, not later than 14 days following each increment of progress date in the schedule and the final date for compliance. That report shall state whether the discharger is in compliance with the scheduled increment of progress. If compliance was not achieved, the report shall state the date by which the discharger expects to comply with the scheduled increment of progress, the reason for the failure to comply, and the steps being taken by the discharger to maintain the established compliance schedule.\n\n\t(iv)\tThe time limit specified in this paragraph for operation or maintenance improvements or additional pretreatment may be extended by the Board.\n\n\t3.\tMonitoring Facilities.\u00a0 The Director may require to be provided, operated and maintained at the discharger\u2019s expense, separate and secured monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the discharge. The monitoring facilities ordinarily shall be situated on the discharger\u2019s premises and in said event the Director shall be granted total and unrestricted access thereto and use thereof by the discharger as a condition of that discharger\u2019s permit; however, at its discretion the Board may allow monitoring facilities to be constructed off-premises.\n\n\t4.\tMonitoring and Sampling.\n\n\t(a)\tPre-Notification.\u00a0 Any discharger may be required by the Director, by permit or otherwise, to engage in periodic monitoring and sampling of its discharge.\u00a0 Where a discharger is required to monitor or sample, the discharger shall notify the Director by telephone at least 48 hours in advance of any monitoring or sampling to be performed.\u00a0 Notification shall include the date, time and location of proposed monitoring and sampling.\u00a0 Monitoring and sampling shall be carried out during a period of normal operations.\u00a0 Prior to the commencement of any sampling or monitoring, the Director may request that the discharger furnish to the Director a split sample and all supporting data (i.e., methodology, flow measuring data, strip chart recordings, and other pertinent information).\u00a0 The Director reserves the right to refuse any data developed from the monitoring or sampling activity if the discharger fails to comply with the pre-notification procedure.\n\n\t(b)\tNotification of Discharge Violations and Resampling.\u00a0 If sampling performed by a discharger indicates a violation, the discharger shall notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.\u00a0 The discharger shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the discharger is not required to resample if:\n\n\t(1)\tThe Director performs sampling at the discharger\u2019s facility at a frequency of at least once per month, or\n\n\t(2)\tThe Director performs sampling at the discharger\u2019s facility between the time when the discharger performs its initial sampling and the time the discharger receives the results of this sampling.\n\n\t(c)\tRepresentative Samples.\u00a0 Samples shall represent the normal wastewater flow to the POTW over a 24-hour period.\u00a0 Composite samples shall be collected according to time or flow as specified by the Director, with at least one sample collected hourly.\u00a0 The Director may require grab samples or continuous monitoring as deemed appropriate (e.g. pH and flow).\u00a0 Samples may be collected either manually or by automatic integrated sampling equipment approved by the Director.\n\n\t(d)\tSample Analysis.\u00a0 The handling, storage, and analysis of all samples taken for the determination of the characteristics of wastewater discharged shall be performed by laboratories certified by the State of California and shall be in accordance with the procedures established by the EPA pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, as amended.\u00a0 In the absence of a State certification process, the Director may approve of a laboratory to perform any necessary sampling and analysis.\n\n\t5.\tInspection and Sampling.\n\n\t(a)\tInspections to Enforce Local, State, and Federal Laws.\u00a0 Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of or perform any duty imposed by this section or other applicable law, or whenever the Director has reasonable cause to believe that there exists upon any premises any violation of the provisions of this section or other applicable law, or any condition which makes such premises hazardous, unsafe, or dangerous, the Director is hereby authorized to enter such property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and perform any duty imposed upon the Director by this section or other applicable law provided that:\n\n\t(1)\tIf the property is occupied, the Director shall first present proper credentials to the occupant and request entry explaining the reasons therefore and;\n\n\t(2)\tIf the property is unoccupied the Director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the property and request entry, explaining the reasons therefore.\u00a0 If such entry is refused or cannot be obtained because the owner or other person having charge or control of the property cannot be found after due diligence, the Director shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure lawful entry and inspect the property.\n\n\t(b)\tInspections to Safeguard the Public Health or Safety.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Director has reasonable cause to believe that wastewater discharge conditions on or emanating from the premises are so hazardous, unsafe or dangerous as to require immediate inspection to safeguard the public health or safety, the Director shall have the right to immediately enter and inspect the property, and may use any reasonable means required to effect such entry and make such inspection, whether the property is occupied or unoccupied and whether or not formal permission to inspect has been obtained. If the property is occupied, the Director shall first present proper credentials to the occupant and demand entry, explaining the reasons therefor and the purpose of the inspection.\n\n\t(c)\tPenalty for Refusal to Permit Director to Make Inspections.\u00a0 No person shall fail or refuse, after proper demand has been made upon that person as provided in Paragraph (b) of this Subdivision 5, to promptly permit the Director to make any inspection provided for by said Paragraph (b). Any person violating this subdivision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n\t(d)\tConsent and Agreement to Enter Premises.\u00a0 The applicant, by accepting any permit issued pursuant to this section, does thereby consent and agree to the entry upon the premises, described in the permit, by Department personnel for the following purposes as required by this section or other applicable laws. The City shall be afforded access at all reasonable times:\n\n\t(1)\tfor the purposes of inspection, sampling, flow measurement, examination of records in the performance of other authorized duties;\n\n\t(2)\tto set up on the discharger\u2019s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspections, compliance-monitoring, flow measuring or metering operations;\n\n\t(3)\tto inspect and copy any records, reports, test results or other information required to carry out the provisions of this section; and\n\n\t(4)\tto photograph any waste, waste container, vehicle, waste treatment process, discharge location, or violation discovered during an inspection.\n\n\t(e)\tEntry of Premises with Security Measures.\u00a0 Where a discharger has instituted security measures requiring proper identification and clearance before entry onto the premises, the discharger shall make all necessary arrangements with its security guards in order that, upon presentation of such identification, City personnel shall be permitted to enter the premises without delay for the purpose of performing their authorized duties.\n\n\t6.\tPublic Access to Information.\u00a0 Discharge and effluent data provided to the City by the discharger shall be available to the public without restriction. Other information may be subject to a claim of confidentiality by the discharger. All information which is submitted to the City by the discharger shall be available to the public, at least to the extent provided by 40 CFR 2.302. With the exception of governmental agencies, any person requesting this information from the City shall be required, prior to the receipt of the requested information, to pay the reasonable cost of said data gathering, reproduction and transmission incurred by the City.\n\n\t7.\tConfidentiality.\u00a0 All information, except for discharge and effluent data, submitted to the City pursuant to this section may be claimed by the discharger to be confidential. Any such claim must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data to the City. The claim may be asserted by stamping the words \u201cConfidential Business Information\u201d on each page containing such information or by other means, however, if no claim is asserted at the time of submission, the City may make the information available to the public without further notice. If such a claim is asserted, the information will be treated in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 2 (Public Information).\n\n\t8.\tFalsifying Information.\u00a0 No person shall knowingly make any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed with the Director or required to be maintained pursuant to this section, or tamper with or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring device required under this section.\n\n\t9.\tRules and Regulations.\u00a0 The Board shall adopt rules and regulations consistent with this section to effectuate its purpose and intent.\n\n\tD.\tFees and Charges.\n\n\t1.\tPurpose and Disposition.\u00a0 It is the purpose of this subsection to provide for the recovery of City costs associated with the discharge of wastewater to the POTW.\u00a0 With the exception of Wastewater Sampling and Analysis Fees, all fees and money collected by the City pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deposited into the Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund established by Section 64.19.2 of this Code. Monies required hereunder to be deposited into that Fund shall be expended for the purposes set forth in said section and to provide for any appropriate refunds relative to such fees.\n\n\t2.\tApplication Fees.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

C Fee Payment Schedule.\u00a0 Each permittee, except the Class I Subclass group, shall make quarterly payments in arrears on the first of April, July, October or January, following the first permit anniversary date.\n\n\t(e)\tClass I Subclass Fee Payment Schedule.\u00a0 Permittees under the Class I SubClass group shall commence making annual payments on the first of April, July, October or January, following the first quarterly period in which their permit becomes effective.\n\n\t4.\tQuality Surcharge Fee.\n\n\t(a)\tQuality Surcharge Fee Requirement.\u00a0 The Sewer Service Charge (SSC), as established under Sections 64.41 of the Code, recovers the cost of treatment of domestic strength wastes discharged to the POTW for treatment.\u00a0 The SSC is paid by all of the users of the POTW.\u00a0 However, industrial wastewater discharged by Industrial Users (IUs) can vary significantly in strength from that of domestic sewage.\u00a0 Industrial wastewater strength can be higher or lower than that of the domestic sewage.\u00a0 A permittee whose discharge is determined to contain BOD or SS, as defined in Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, with concentrations in excess of the designated BOD and SS values in the Board Rules and Regulations shall pay a quality surcharge fee.\n\n\t(b)\tQuality Surcharge Fee Determination.\u00a0 A fee based on the quality\/strength of the Wastewater discharged into the POTW shall be paid quarterly in arrears by all Industrial User or permittees in possession of a valid Industrial Wastewater Permit where the Wastewater of said permittees is found to be subject to the City\u2019s Quality Surcharge Fee and which is treated in a City treatment plant. The permittee may choose to be billed for the City\u2019s Quality Surcharge Fee based on either the provisions of Subsections 64.30 D.4.(b)(1) or 64.30 D.4.(b)(2) below.\n\n\t(1)\t(Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4\/6\/12.)\u00a0 Permittees whose discharge is determined to contain BOD or SS, as defined in Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, with concentrations in excess of the designated BOD and SS values in the Board Rules and Regulations Governing Disposal of Industrial Wastewater Into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works of the City of Los Angeles shall pay a Quality Surcharge Fee (QSF) according to the following formula and provisions.\n\n\tThe Quality Surcharge Fee, for these permittees, shall be determined pursuant to the following formula:\n\n\tC = V [a(SS-DSS) + b(BOD-DBOD)]k\n\n\twhere:\n\n\t\u201cC\u201d is the Quality Surcharge Fee.\n\n\t\u201cV\u201d is the average daily volume of wastewater discharged in gallons and shall be deemed: (1) the volume of water supplied to the premises, adjusted as determined by the Board to account for water not discharged into the POTW; (2) the metered volume of wastewater discharged into the POTW, in accordance with a measuring device approved by the Board; or (3) a figure determined by the Board, based upon any other equitable method.\n\n\t\u201cSS\u201d is the suspended solids as defined in Subdivision 75. of Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, expressed in milligrams per liter.\n\n\t\u201cBOD\u201d is the biochemical oxygen demand of the wastewater as defined in Subdivision 6. of Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, expressed in milligrams per liter.\n\n\t\u201cDSS\u201d is the suspended solids concentration designated by the Board in the Board Rules and Regulations.\n\n\t\u201cDBOD\u201d is the biochemical oxygen demand concentration designated by the Board in the Board Rules and Regulations.\n\n\t\u201ca\u201d, is the verifiable cost assessed for each pound of suspended solids, $0.365.\n\n\t\u201cb\u201d, is the verifiable cost assessed for each pound of biochemical oxygen demand, $0.363.\n\n\t\u201ck\u201d, is (365 x 8.34)\/1,000,000, a dimensional constant to convert C to dollars.\n\n\tThe values for \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d shall be annually adjusted as shown in the table below:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \nEffective

of zero shall be used for the term.\n\n\t(i)\tIn determining the amount of Quality Surcharge Fee to be paid by various industrial users, the Board may establish industry-wide averages for SS and BOD values.\u00a0 The Board may group permittees into appropriate discharge volume ranges each of which shall be represented by an average discharge volume.\u00a0 Where sampling and volume measurements of any permittee are not practical for physical, economic or other reasons, these averages may be used in establishing such permittee\u2019s Quality Surcharge Fee.\n\n\t(ii)\tAny permittee whose fee has been determined in the above manner who is not satisfied that the averages are applicable to its discharge, may submit appropriate engineering data to the Board for its consideration.\u00a0 If the Board finds that such permittee\u2019s discharge differs significantly from the averages established, it may determine the fee on a more appropriate basis.\n\n\t(2)\tPermittees whose discharge is determined to contain BOD or SS, as defined in Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, with concentrations less than the designated BOD and SS\u00a0 values in the Board Rules and Regulations may petition the Board to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate as defined in Section 64.41.01 (o), of the Code.\u00a0 Upon qualification, such permittee may be allowed to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate where the Low-Strength SSC Rate excludes the cost component associated with the domestic sewage strength included in the SSC rate.\u00a0 However, should such a permittee petition and be allowed to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate, such permittee shall simultaneously become subject to the Zero-Based Quality Surcharge Fee (QSF) as defined in Subsection 64.30 D.4.(c) below.\u00a0 This fee is to recover the treatment cost associated with removal of BOD and SS, as defined below, in the permittee\u2019s discharge.\u00a0 This fee is also representative of and a replacement for the strength cost component of the Sewer Service Charge (SSC) not included in the Low-Strength SSC Rate as defined in Section 64.41.01 (o) of the Code.\n\n\tThe Quality Surcharge Fee, for these permittees, shall be determined pursuant to the following formula:\n\n\tC\u00a0 =\u00a0 V [a(SS) + b(BOD)]k\n\n\twhere:\n\n\tC, V, a, b, k, BOD and SS are defined under Section 64.30, Subsection D.4.(b) above.\n\n\t(c)\tZero-Based Quality Surcharge Fee Qualifications and Requirements.\u00a0 Any discharger, in possession of a valid Industrial Wastewater Permit, that petitions to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate and a Zero-Based QSF, shall meet the following qualifications and requirements:\n\n\t(1)\tThe discharger, if not in possession of a valid Industrial Wastewater Permit, must apply for and obtain an industrial wastewater discharge permit as defined under Subsection 64.30 C.1. of the Code.\n\n\t(2)\tThe permittee must petition, in writing, to the Board to be placed on the Zero-Based Quality Surcharge Fee;\n\n\t(3)\tThe permittee must submit analytical data of its discharge, at the time of and with its petition, to demonstrate that the strength of its discharge does qualify for the Low-Strength SSC Rate;\n\n\t(4)\tThe permittee shall become subject to self monitoring of its discharge, per Industrial Waste Management Division policies and also as defined and established in Section 9 of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations and,\n\n\t(5)\tThe permittee shall install a sampling facility, for the purposes of self-monitoring, in accordance to the requirements set forth by the Director.\n\n\t(d)\tDetermination of Surcharge Fees for Ground Solid Wastes.\u00a0 Where ground solid wastes such as garbage, market refuse, food plant wastes and hospital wastes are discharged to the POTW, their weights shall be recorded prior to disposal or may be estimated by the Board, and a dry weight loading calculated for determination of surcharges. Food processors which grind food plant wastes for discharge to the POTW and hospitals which grind infectious wastes for discharge to the POTW may be required to report quarterly the total weight of material ground for surcharge determination.\n\n\t5.\tPrivate Septage Disposal Facility (PSDF) Fees.\u00a0 Subject to the provisions of this Subsection, all PSDFs shall pay, quarterly in arrears, the following fees and discharge user rates:\n\n\t(a)\tPSDF Inspection and Control Fee.\u00a0 An annual Inspection and Control (I &#038; C) Fee, in the amount corresponding to the I and Classification Number as set forth in Table 1 of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations and;\n\n\t(b)\tPSDF Septage Treatment Cost Recovery User Fee.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

These include, but are not limited to, immediate blockage or disconnection of the discharger\u2019s connection to the POTW, and a request to the Department of Water and Power that it discontinue water service of the affected property until full compliance with the Notice to Comply has been achieved.\n\n\t(d)\tNotice of an Intended Order of Suspension.\u00a0 The Director in the event of violation of this section, may serve the discharger with a notice of an intended order of suspension, stating the reasons therefor, the opportunity for a hearing with respect thereto, and the proposed effective date of the intended order.\n\n\t(e)\tOrder of Suspension Board Hearing.\u00a0 Any discharger suspended or served with a notice of an intended order of suspension may file with the Secretary of the Board a request for a Board hearing with respect thereto. Filing of such request shall not stay a suspension. In the event a suspension of a permit due to imminent hazard related to continued discharge, the discharger may request a hearing, and the Board or a hearing examiner designated by the Board for that purpose, shall conduct a hearing within three days of receipt of the request. In the event of hearing requests, for other than an imminent hazard suspension, the Board shall hold a hearing on the suspension within 14 days of receipt of the request. At the close of the hearing the Board shall make its determination whether to terminate, or conditionally terminate the suspension imposed by the Director, or the Board may cause the permit to be revoked. Except in the case of a hearing within three days being required as above provided, reasonable notice of the hearing shall be given to the suspended discharger in the manner provided for in Subdivision 6 of Subsection E of this section.\n\n\t(f)\tStay of Order of Suspension.\u00a0 In the event that the Board fails to meet within the time set forth above or fails to make a determination within 72 hours after the close of the hearing, the order of suspension shall be stayed until a Board determination is made with respect to the action of the Director.\n\n\t(g)\tReinstatement of Industrial Wastewater Permit.\u00a0 The Director shall reinstate the Industrial Wastewater Permit upon proof of compliance which ends the emergency nature of the hazard created by the discharge that had been cause for the Director to initiate the suspension, provided that the Director is satisfied that all discharge requirements of this section, the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, and any Board order will be implemented.\n\n\t2.\tRevocation of Industrial Wastewater Permit.\u00a0 The Board may revoke an Industrial Wastewater Permit upon a finding that the discharger has violated any provision of this section or the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations. No revocation shall be ordered until a notice and hearing on the question has been held by the Board as provided in Subdivisions 4 and 5 of this Subsection E of Section 64.30.\n\n\t3.\tAdditional Emergency Remedial Measures.\u00a0 The Director shall have full power and authority to take any necessary precautions including but not limited to, decontamination, sewer closure, packaging, diking, and transportation of materials, in order to protect life, protect property, or prevent further damage resulting from a condition that is likely to result in a discharge which presents an imminent hazard to the public health, safety or welfare; or which either singly or by interaction with other discharges, is an imminent hazard to the POTW; or which places the City in violation of its NPDES permit. In the pursuit of such an operation, City personnel, any party contracting with the City, or duly authorized representative of another governmental agency shall have immediate access to the premises. The Director may prohibit approach to the scene of such emergency by any person vehicle, vessel or thing, and all persons not actually employed in the extinguishment of the condition or the preservation of lives and property in the vicinity thereof.\n\n\t4.\tBoard Hearing.\n\n\t(a)\tAppointment of Hearing Examiner.\u00a0 With respect to permit revocation or suspension hearings, the Board may conduct the hearing or may appoint one or more examiners or designate one or more of its members to serve as hearing examiners and to conduct a hearing with respect to any appeal or protest filed. At such hearing the discharger may appear personally or through counsel, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence in the discharger\u2019s behalf.\n\n\t(b)\tBoard Decision.\u00a0 The hearing examiner or examiners, if other than the Board, shall submit a written report and recommendations to the Board together with a brief summary of the evidence considered and conclusions reached with respect thereto. The Board, after considering evidence presented at such a hearing, and any report submitted to it with respect to such a hearing, or after any hearing which it conducts, shall adopt findings supported by evidence, and may adopt, reject, or modify in whole or in part, make its decision, and issue its order. If the Board\u2019s order is to revoke the discharger\u2019s Industrial Wastewater Permit, the order may be effective forthwith, or at a later specified date. The discharger shall be notified in writing of the Board\u2019s action.\n\n\t(c)\tCompliance with Order of Revocation.\u00a0 Any discharger whose Industrial Wastewater Permit has been revoked shall immediately cease and desist all discharge of any wastewater covered by the Permit. The Board may disconnect or permanently block the discharger\u2019s connection if such action is necessary to ensure compliance with the order of revocation.\n\n\t(d)\tConditions for Resumption of Discharge after Permit Revocation.\u00a0 After revocation of a discharger\u2019s Industrial Wastewater Permit, there shall be no further discharge of industrial wastewater by that discharger into the POTW unless there has been a new application filed, all fees and charges that would be required upon an initial application and all delinquent fees, charges, penalties and other sums owed by the discharger and\/or the applicant to the City have been paid to the City, and a new Industrial Wastewater Permit has been issued. Any costs incurred by the City, including administrative costs and investigative fees, in revoking the Permit and disconnecting the connection if necessary, shall also be paid for by the discharger before issuance of a new Industrial Wastewater Permit.\n\n\t5.\tNotice.\u00a0 Notice of the hearing shall be given to the discharger at least ten (10) days prior to the date of hearing. Unless otherwise provided herein, any notice required to be given by the Director under this section shall be in writing and served in person or by registered or certified mail addressed to the addressee\u2019s last known address with request for return receipt. Where no address is known, service may be made upon the owner of record of the property upon which the alleged violation occurred or by posting the notice conspicuously on the property.\n\n\tNotice shall be deemed to have been given at the time the written notice is deposited, postage prepaid, in the United States mail at Los Angeles, California.\n\n\t6.\tPublic List of Significant Noncompliant Industrial Dischargers.\u00a0 The Director shall identify a discharger as meeting one or more of the Significant Noncompliance (SNC) criteria listed in 40 CFR Section 403.8(f)(2)(vii) and shall publish notice in the largest daily newspaper published in the City of such status. The criteria for SNC shall be as follows:\n\n\t(a)\tSixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken during a 6 month period exceed the discharge limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;\n\n\t(b)\tThirty-three percent (33%) or more of the wastewater measurements taken during a 6 month period for each pollutant equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);\n\n\t(c)\tAny other effluent violation that the Director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);\n\n\t(d)\tAny discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public, human health or welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the City\u2019s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;\n\n\t(e)\tFailure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a permit or Administrative Order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;\n\n\t(f)\tFailure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports such as 90 day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;\n\n\t(g)\tFailure to accurately report noncompliance;\n\n\t(h)\tAny other violation or group of violations that the Director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of its pretreatment program.\n\n\t7.\tPenalties for Violations.\n\n\t(a)\tCriminal Penalty.\u00a0 Except as expressly provided, violation of this section or any order issued by the Board or the Director as authorized by this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation per day or by imprisonment in the County jail for a period of not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\n\n\t(b)\tInjunctive Relief.\u00a0 Whenever a discharger of wastewater is in violation of this section or otherwise causes or threatens to cause a condition of contamination, pollution or nuisance, the Board or the Director may cause the City to seek a petition to the Superior Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, restraining order, or other order, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such discharge.\n\n\t(c)\tCivil Liability.\u00a0 Any person who violates any provision of this section or any term or condition of any permit issued pursuant to this section or plan approval which prohibits or limits the discharge of any waste imposes any pretreatment requirement shall be civilly liable to the City in the maximum sum provided by law for each day in which such violation occurs.\n\n\tF.\tConflict.\u00a0

authorize the installation of alternative grease removal devices.\u00a0 Alternative grease removal devices include, but are not limited to, devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and prevent it from being discharged into the POTW.\u00a0 All alternative grease removal devices must be approved by the Director, on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 The FSE must also demonstrate that BMPs have been implemented.\t2.\tReporting Requirements.\t(a)\tFederal Reporting Requirements and Additional Reporting Requirements.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the reporting requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 403, including, but not limited to, the requirements as set forth in 40 CFR \u00a7403.12, the Director may impose additional reporting requirements by permit or otherwise.\t(b)\tReporting by Dischargers Subject to NCPS.\u00a0 Unless required more frequently or otherwise specified by the Director, dischargers which are subject to NCPS shall submit, to the Director, semi-annually, a Periodic Compliance Report which shall contain, at a minimum, the information required by 40 CFR \u00a7403.12(e).\u00a0 The Director may require a discharger to submit such reports on a more frequent basis and may base such decision upon the amount of discharge or other site-specific concerns the Director may have pertaining to the discharge.\u00a0 In addition, dischargers that are subject to NCPS shall submit Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMRs) and Reports on Compliance (RC) in accordance with the General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution (Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403.12).\t(c)\tReporting by SIUs not Subject To NCPS.\u00a0 Unless required more frequently by the Director, dischargers which are Significant Industrial Users but are not subject to NCPS shall submit to the Director semi-annually a report indicating the nature, concentration and flow of pollutants in the effluent which are required to be reported by the Director.\u00a0 At a minimum, the report shall contain the information required by 40 CFR \u00a7 403.12(h).\t(d)\tProduction Data.\u00a0 The Director may require any discharger to submit production data.\u00a0 At a minimum, dischargers subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits or subject to production-based NCPS shall report production data as follows:\t(1)\tDischargers subject to NCPS in which equivalent mass or concentration limits are established by the Director in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7403.6(c) shall report a reasonable measure of long term production rate (based upon the criteria used for developing the discharger\u2019s effluent limitations) in its Report on Compliance and its Periodic Compliance Reports, as applicable.\u00a0 In addition, such dischargers shall notify the Director in accordance with Paragraph (e) of this Subdivision after the discharger has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month.\t(2)\tAll other dischargers subject to NCPS expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of production) shall include information on the actual production during the sampling period in its Report on Compliance and its Periodic Compliance Reports, as applicable.\t(e)\tNotification of Changed Discharge.\t(1)\tAll industrial dischargers shall provide written notification to the Director before any planned change, including physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility, production increases and anticipated process changes which will result in a substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants to be discharged, including notification of changes in the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the discharger has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR \u00a7403.12(p).\u00a0 Notice shall be provided at least ninety (90) days before the change, except if such notice is not feasible, the discharger shall provide the Director notice as soon as the information becomes available.\t(2)\tNo wastewater discharge shall be commenced, without notification to and approval by the Director, in which there has been a substantial change in the volume or characteristic which causes it to be different from that expressly allowed under the permit issued.\u00a0 Upon such notification, the Director, in his\/her discretion, may require that a new application be filed and a new permit obtained before any wastewater discharge involving the changed characteristic takes place.\t(f)\tSignatory\/Certification for Baseline Monitoring Reports, Reports on Compliance, and Periodic Compliance Reports.\u00a0 Baseline Monitoring Reports, Reports on Compliance and Periodic Compliance Reports submitted by dischargers subject to NCPS shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger and shall contain the following certification:\tI certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.\u00a0 Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.\u00a0 I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.\t(g)\tSignatory\/Certification for Other Reports.\u00a0 The Director, at his\/her discretion, may require other reports or information submitted by dischargers subject to NCPS, or any other discharger, to meet signatory\/certification requirements as the Director deems appropriate.\t(h)\tAdoption of New City Specific Pollutant Limitations.\u00a0 Within 180 days after promulgation of a new City Specific Pollutant Limitation and notification thereof by the Board to specific dischargers affected thereby, any discharger subject to such limitations shall submit to the Director a report containing:\t(1)\tThe name and address of the discharger;\t(2)\tThe address or location of the premises where the discharge does or will take place;\t(3)\tThe nature, average production rate, and Standard Industrial Classification of the operations carried out by the discharger;\t(4)\tThe average and maximum flow of the discharge in gallons per day;\t(5)\tThe nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process and identification of applicable limitations. The concentration shall be reported as a maximum or average as provided in applicable limitations. If equivalent concentration limits have been calculated in accordance with the limitation, this adjusted concentration limit shall also be submitted;\t(6)\tA statement, reviewed by an authorized representative and certified under penalty of perjury by a person with primary responsibility for the operation which contributes to the discharge, indicating whether the limitations are being met, and, if not, what operation and maintenance improvements or additional pretreatment is required for compliance;\t(7)\tThe shortest schedule under which any additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance improvements required as a result of the new limitations or requirements imposed pursuant to Paragraph (a) of Subdivision 1 of Subsection C of this section will be completed.\t(i)\tThe completion date in such a schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable limitation.\t(ii)\tThe schedule shall provide for reporting increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of any additional pretreatment necessary (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, completing construction).\t(iii)\tThe discharger shall also submit a written progress report to the Director, not later than 14 days following each increment of progress date in the schedule and the final date for compliance. That report shall state whether the discharger is in compliance with the scheduled increment of progress. If compliance was not achieved, the report shall state the date by which the discharger expects to comply with the scheduled increment of progress, the reason for the failure to comply, and the steps being taken by the discharger to maintain the established compliance schedule.\t(iv)\tThe time limit specified in this paragraph for operation or maintenance improvements or additional pretreatment may be extended by the Board.\t3.\tMonitoring Facilities.\u00a0 The Director may require to be provided, operated and maintained at the discharger\u2019s expense, separate and secured monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the discharge. The monitoring facilities ordinarily shall be situated on the discharger\u2019s premises and in said event the Director shall be granted total and unrestricted access thereto and use thereof by the discharger as a condition of that discharger\u2019s permit; however, at its discretion the Board may allow monitoring facilities to be constructed off-premises.\t4.\tMonitoring and Sampling.\t(a)\tPre-Notification.\u00a0 Any discharger may be required by the Director, by permit or otherwise, to engage in periodic monitoring and sampling of its discharge.\u00a0 Where a discharger is required to monitor or sample, the discharger shall notify the Director by telephone at least 48 hours in advance of any monitoring or sampling to be performed.\u00a0 Notification shall include the date, time and location of proposed monitoring and sampling.\u00a0 Monitoring and sampling shall be carried out during a period of normal operations.\u00a0 Prior to the commencement of any sampling or monitoring, the Director may request that the discharger furnish to the Director a split sample and all supporting data (i.e., methodology, flow measuring data, strip chart recordings, and other pertinent information).\u00a0 The Director reserves the right to refuse any data developed from the monitoring or sampling activity if the discharger fails to comply with the pre-notification procedure.\t(b)\tNotification of Discharge Violations and Resampling.\u00a0 If sampling performed by a discharger indicates a violation, the discharger shall notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.\u00a0 The discharger shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the discharger is not required to resample if:\t(1)\tThe Director performs sampling at the discharger\u2019s facility at a frequency of at least once per month, or\t(2)\tThe Director performs sampling at the discharger\u2019s facility between the time when the discharger performs its initial sampling and the time the discharger receives the results of this sampling.\t(c)\tRepresentative Samples.\u00a0 Samples shall represent the normal wastewater flow to the POTW over a 24-hour period.\u00a0 Composite samples shall be collected according to time or flow as specified by the Director, with at least one sample collected hourly.\u00a0 The Director may require grab samples or continuous monitoring as deemed appropriate (e.g. pH and flow).\u00a0 Samples may be collected either manually or by automatic integrated sampling equipment approved by the Director.\t(d)\tSample Analysis.\u00a0 The handling, storage, and analysis of all samples taken for the determination of the characteristics of wastewater discharged shall be performed by laboratories certified by the State of California and shall be in accordance with the procedures established by the EPA pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, as amended.\u00a0 In the absence of a State certification process, the Director may approve of a laboratory to perform any necessary sampling and analysis.\t5.\tInspection and Sampling.\t(a)\tInspections to Enforce Local, State, and Federal Laws.\u00a0 Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of or perform any duty imposed by this section or other applicable law, or whenever the Director has reasonable cause to believe that there exists upon any premises any violation of the provisions of this section or other applicable law, or any condition which makes such premises hazardous, unsafe, or dangerous, the Director is hereby authorized to enter such property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and perform any duty imposed upon the Director by this section or other applicable law provided that:\t(1)\tIf the property is occupied, the Director shall first present proper credentials to the occupant and request entry explaining the reasons therefore and;\t(2)\tIf the property is unoccupied the Director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the property and request entry, explaining the reasons therefore.\u00a0 If such entry is refused or cannot be obtained because the owner or other person having charge or control of the property cannot be found after due diligence, the Director shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure lawful entry and inspect the property.\t(b)\tInspections to Safeguard the Public Health or Safety.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Director has reasonable cause to believe that wastewater discharge conditions on or emanating from the premises are so hazardous, unsafe or dangerous as to require immediate inspection to safeguard the public health or safety, the Director shall have the right to immediately enter and inspect the property, and may use any reasonable means required to effect such entry and make such inspection, whether the property is occupied or unoccupied and whether or not formal permission to inspect has been obtained. If the property is occupied, the Director shall first present proper credentials to the occupant and demand entry, explaining the reasons therefor and the purpose of the inspection.\t(c)\tPenalty for Refusal to Permit Director to Make Inspections.\u00a0 No person shall fail or refuse, after proper demand has been made upon that person as provided in Paragraph (b) of this Subdivision 5, to promptly permit the Director to make any inspection provided for by said Paragraph (b). Any person violating this subdivision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\t(d)\tConsent and Agreement to Enter Premises.\u00a0 The applicant, by accepting any permit issued pursuant to this section, does thereby consent and agree to the entry upon the premises, described in the permit, by Department personnel for the following purposes as required by this section or other applicable laws. The City shall be afforded access at all reasonable times:\t(1)\tfor the purposes of inspection, sampling, flow measurement, examination of records in the performance of other authorized duties;\t(2)\tto set up on the discharger\u2019s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspections, compliance-monitoring, flow measuring or metering operations;\t(3)\tto inspect and copy any records, reports, test results or other information required to carry out the provisions of this section; and\t(4)\tto photograph any waste, waste container, vehicle, waste treatment process, discharge location, or violation discovered during an inspection.\t(e)\tEntry of Premises with Security Measures.\u00a0 Where a discharger has instituted security measures requiring proper identification and clearance before entry onto the premises, the discharger shall make all necessary arrangements with its security guards in order that, upon presentation of such identification, City personnel shall be permitted to enter the premises without delay for the purpose of performing their authorized duties.\t6.\tPublic Access to Information.\u00a0 Discharge and effluent data provided to the City by the discharger shall be available to the public without restriction. Other information may be subject to a claim of confidentiality by the discharger. All information which is submitted to the City by the discharger shall be available to the public, at least to the extent provided by 40 CFR 2.302. With the exception of governmental agencies, any person requesting this information from the City shall be required, prior to the receipt of the requested information, to pay the reasonable cost of said data gathering, reproduction and transmission incurred by the City.\t7.\tConfidentiality.\u00a0 All information, except for discharge and effluent data, submitted to the City pursuant to this section may be claimed by the discharger to be confidential. Any such claim must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data to the City. The claim may be asserted by stamping the words \u201cConfidential Business Information\u201d on each page containing such information or by other means, however, if no claim is asserted at the time of submission, the City may make the information available to the public without further notice.
