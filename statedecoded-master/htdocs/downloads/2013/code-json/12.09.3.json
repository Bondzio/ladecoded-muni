It is also the purpose of this ordinance to encourage the maintenance of the property for residential uses by allowing land zoned RMP to be used for single family dwellings. Because of the usual location of these lots in areas with industrial and manufacturing uses, the preservation of the property for single family residential use may require the variation from some of the standard housing requirements necessary or desirable in the rest of the City. Accordingly, the large lot minimum yard area requirements are necessary to ensure compatibility between single family residential uses and possible surrounding nonresidential uses.\n\n\tB.\tUse. \u00a0 No building, structure or land shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected, moved onto the site, structurally altered, enlarged or maintained, except for such uses as may be permitted therein:\n\n\t1.\tMobilehome parks.\n\n\t2.\tOne-family dwellings.\n\n\t3.\tParks, playgrounds or community centers, owned and operated by a governmental agency.\n\n\t4.\tTruck gardening; the keeping of equines, poultry, rabbits and chinchillas, in conjunction with the residential use of the lot, provided that such animal keeping is not for commercial purposes.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.
