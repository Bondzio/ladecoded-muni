Provided, however, that the Council, upon determining that a different density would be more in accord with the public health, safety and welfare after considering the existing, proposed and ultimate traffic, sewage, drainage and other facilities in the area or any other pertinent information, and after report and recommendation from the City Planning Commission, may by resolution establish a different density than that shown on the adopted General Plan. In such instances the number of lots permitted on the Private Street Map may be based on the densities established by such resolution so long as the size of such lots is not less than that required by the applicable zoning provisions. Should the Commission fail to act upon a request for different density within 50 days of its submission such request shall be transferred to the Council for action thereon.\tEach Private Street Map shall substantially conform to all other elements of the General Plan as adopted by the Commission.","type":"section","prefixes":[""],"prefix":"","entire_prefix":"","prefix_anchor":"","level":1}}}
