	(Amended by Ord. No. 150,456, Eff. 12/30/77.)

	(a)	Immediate suspension:&#xA0; The General Manager of the Department or his authorized representative may immediately suspend a permit when it is determined that an emergency involving public health or safety requires such suspension. Permittee shall be given notice of such suspension in writing delivered to the permittee either in person or by registered letter.

	(b)	Temporary suspension:&#xA0; The General Manager of the Department or his authorized representative may temporarily suspend any permit. Such temporary suspension shall be after the permittee has been given notice to appear before the General Manager or his authorized representative for a hearing on the charges. Such notice shall include the basis for the proposed charges. The permittee shall have the right to respond either orally or in writing. If after hearing it is determined that cause for suspension exists the permittee may accept the suspension of the permit or fill out a prescribed form requesting a hearing before the Board. The Board shall consider such request and the grounds therefor and shall take appropriate actions thereon subject to the provisions of Section 71.07.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 165,491, Eff. 3/19/90.)

	(c)	Permanent suspension, revocation or cancellation:&#xA0; Whenever investigation determines that cause for permanent suspension, revocation or cancellation of a permit exists, the permittee shall be given notice to appear before the Board for a hearing.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 165,491, Eff. 3/19/90.)

	(d)	Waiver of hearing:&#xA0; Failure of permittee to respond to a notice to appear for a hearing before the General Manager of the Department or his authorized representative or before the Board is a waiver of the right to a hearing and action may be taken without permittee being present.

	(e)	(Added by Ord. No. 165,491, Eff. 3/19/90.)&#xA0; The General Manager of the Department or his authorized representative, or any officer of the Los Angeles Police Department, may take possession of any badge, card, permit, license or vehicle decal issued under the provisions of this chapter, upon expiration, revocation, cancellation or suspension thereof, or which is fictitious or which has been unlawfully or erroneously issued. Any decal, or other taxicab or vehicle identification as approved by the Board, which is not attached to the vehicle for which it was issued may be seized.

	Any such document or decal seized shall be delivered to the Department.</full_text><order_by>09</order_by><ancestry><unit id="51" label="article"><name>Public Transportation</name><identifier>1</identifier><url>/7/1/</url></unit><unit id="50" label="chapter"><name>Transporation</name><identifier>7</identifier><url>/7/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="699"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.00</section_number><catch_line>Scope And Definitions.</catch_line><url>/71.00/</url><token>71.00</token></unit><unit id="2322"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.01</section_number><catch_line>Authority Of Board To Adopt Rules.</catch_line><url>/71.01/</url><token>71.01</token></unit><unit id="239"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.01.1</section_number><catch_line>Authority Of Designated Employees Of The Department Of Transportation To Make Arrests And Issue Citations.</catch_line><url>/71.01.1/</url><token>71.01.1</token></unit><unit id="3617"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.01.2</section_number><catch_line>Authority Of Designated Employees Of The Department Of Transportation To Have Access To Local Summary Criminal History Information.</catch_line><url>/71.01.2/</url><token>71.01.2</token></unit><unit id="3076"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.02</section_number><catch_line>Operation Of Vehicles &#x2013;
