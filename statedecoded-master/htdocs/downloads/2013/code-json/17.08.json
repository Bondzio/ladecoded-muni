Such certificates of deposit may provide that interest shall be paid to the depositor. The assignment shall allow the City to withdraw the principal amount, or any portion thereof, upon declaration of default by the Board of Public Works without the necessity of any further consent by the depositor. The Improvement Security shall be on a form prepared by the City Engineer, shall be a joint and several obligation, and shall be in an amount estimated by the City Engineer to be reasonably necessary to complete the construction and installation of all of the improvements required to be done pursuant to the Improvement Agreement and to warrant the work against defective work or labor done, or defective materials furnished in the performance of the work.\n\n\tThe term of the Improvement Security shall begin on the day it is approved by the City Council and shall continue until the work is accepted by the City Engineer.\n\n\tThe Improvement Security shall contain the further conditions that in addition to the face amount, all parties executing the security shall be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for payment of all reasonable costs, expenses and fees, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the City in enforcing the obligation secured thereby; that all parties agree to any extensions of time within which to construct and install the improvements; and that all parties further agree to such alterations of or additions to the work as may be deemed necessary by the City Engineer provided the cost increase does not exceed 10 percent of the value of the Improvement Security.\n\n\tc.\tImprovement Warranty Guarantee.

The City Engineer may consent to two reductions provided the original security for the improvements exceeds $200,000 and the work completed is identifiable, capable of being maintained by the City, and accepted by the City Engineer. In extreme hardship circumstances the City Engineer may consent to one reduction without regard to the preceding provisions. The remaining security shall be adequate to cover the estimated cost of completing the remaining improvements, the improvement warranty guarantee, and reasonable expenses and fees for enforcement of the terms of the Improvement Agreement. If a cash deposit or negotiable security is on deposit, that portion of the cash or negotiable security not required as a guarantee for the remaining improvements, improvement warranty guarantee and reasonable expenses and fees for enforcement of the terms of the Improvement Agreement, shall be returned to the depositor. If a certificate of deposit is on file, reduction in the Improvement Security will be accomplished by the City Engineer issuing a notice of reduction to the depositor and financial institution.

However, if the improvement warranty guarantee has not expired, the City Engineer may issue a Certificate of Acceptance, which exonerates the portion of the Improvement Security guaranteeing completion of the construction and installation of the improvements, but not the improvement warranty guarantee. Said warranty guarantee shall thereafter be released in total by the City Engineer on or after one year from the date of the completion notice from the Bureau of Engineering, provided no claims against said guarantee have been made by the City.\n\n\t6.\tRelease of Labor and Material Payment Security.

If a cash, negotiable security, or certificate of deposit payment security is on file, the City Engineer shall:\n\n\ta.\tRelease the cash, negotiable security or certificate of deposit payment bond in total, if no claims have been filed; or\n\n\tb.\tReduce the cash or negotiable security or certificate of deposit payment bond to an amount equal to one\u2013hundred and fifty (150) percent total amount of the claims filed with the City Clerk.\n\n\tH.\tEnforcement.\u00a0 If the subdivider\/owner neglects, refuses or fails to construct the improvements with such diligence as to insure completion within the time specified, or within such extensions of said time as may have been granted by the City Engineer or the Board of Public Works or if the subdivider\/owner neglects, refuses or fails to perform satisfactorily any act required under the Improvement Agreement, the Board of Public Works may declare the Improvement Agreement in default, and shall take whatever actions are necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Improvement Security. The Board is hereby empowered to order all or any part of the work to be done either by City forces or by separate contract, and the City shall be entitled to reimbursement for all costs and expenses as a result of such construction. If the Improvement Security is a cash deposit, negotiable security or certificate of deposit the Board is empowered to deduct therefrom, on behalf of the City, an amount sufficient to reimburse and to indemnity the City for any and all damages, costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the City in enforcing the terms and conditions of the Improvement Agreement.","order_by":"08","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"8","name":"Division Of Land Regulations","identifier":"7","label":"article","url":"\/1\/7\/"},"2":{"id":"7","name":"General Provisions and
