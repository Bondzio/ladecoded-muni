VACANT UNITS. (§ 161.703)

  VACANT UNITS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 181,744, Eff. 7/15/11.)	A vacant unit in a property
subject to this Article need not comply with orders under this Section, provided
that a notice is recorded against the property declaring that the unit is and
shall remain vacant, and provided that the unit is secured against unauthorized
entry.  If a dwelling unit declared to be vacant is rented, no rent is due or
owing for that dwelling unit.  The tenant may assert this Section as an
affirmative defense to any unlawful detainer action brought based on nonpayment
of rent.
