SCOPE. (§ 18.00)

  SCOPE.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 122,064, Eff. 6/14/62.)

	A.	The purpose of this article is to prescribe rules and regulations governing
the platting and division of land as lots or building sites which are contiguous
or adjacent to private road easements; to provide for the filing and approval of
Private Street Maps; to provide for the approval of private road easements as
private streets, to provide for the naming of private streets, and to require
that lots or building sites which are contiguous or adjacent to private streets
conform to the minimum requirements of this chapter before permits may be
issued. (Amended by Ord. No. 158,691, Eff. 3/12/84.)

	B.	When private streets have been laid out and designated as such to a recorded
subdivision map or on a filed record of survey map, the provisions of this
article shall not apply thereto.

	C.	When a developed residential lot or building site has its access driveway
located within a private road easement and the dwelling and access driveway
existed prior to September 6, 1961, said private road easement shall be deemed
to have been approved in accordance with the provisions of this article and may
be continued. Further, on such lot or building site additions and alterations
may be made to such dwelling, and accessory buildings may be erected on said lot
if no additional dwelling units or guest rooms are created.

	An ordinance requiring a residence to be built upon a lot having a frontage on
a street or private easement determined by the planning commission to be
adequate for purposes of access is valid and is not an unlawful delegation of
legislative power.
