SUSPENSION OF PERMIT FOR NON-PAYMENT OF FEES. (§ 194.01)

  SUSPENSION OF PERMIT FOR NON-PAYMENT OF FEES.	A.	No privately-owned solid
waste facility permittee may operate under permitted conditions if current fees
and penalties specified under this ordinance are due and not paid.  After
notification of past due fees has been given and documented and non-payment has
been verified by program management, suspension of any and all permits can be
imposed by the LEA until all fees and penalties due to the City are paid.	B.	If
there is a dispute regarding the fee amount, the full amount of the fees and any
past due fees must be paid to avoid suspension of the permit.  To appeal a fee
assessment, a written appeal stating the basis of the appeal must be filed with
the LEA within 21 calendar days of the invoice date.  After an administrative
review, if fees are revised, a refund will be issued.
