Toxic materials shall be divided into the following classifications of hazard:\tClass 4 \u2013 Materials which on very short exposure could cause death or major residual injury even though prompt medical treatment is given.\tClass 3 \u2013 Materials which on short exposure could cause serious temporary or residual injury even though prompt medical treatment is given.\tClass 2 \u2013 Materials which on intense or continued exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury unless prompt medical treatment is given.\tClass 1 \u2013 Materials which on exposure could cause irritation but only minor residual injury even if no treatment is given.\tTransfer Apparatus \u2013 Transfer apparatus shall mean any device or system of devices including pump, motor, piping, meter, hose and nozzle used for transferring flammable liquids, combustible liquids, or liquified flammable gas other than at or in connection with an Auto Fueling Station.\tTreated Bale \u2013 A bale of combustible fibers so treated with chemicals, either by impregnating the fibers or by dipping or spraying the bale, so that it does not present a flash-fire hazard.\tUnstable Material \u2013 Any material, other than explosives, which in the pure state, or as commercially produced, will vigorously polymerize, decompose, condense, or become self-reactive and undergo other violent chemical changes including explosion when exposed to heat, friction, or shock, or in the absence of an inhibitor, or in the presence of contaminants, or in contact with noncompatible materials. Unstable materials shall be divided into the following classifications of hazard:\tClass 4 \u2013 Materials which are readily capable of detonation or of explosive decomposition or explosive reaction at normal temperatures and pressures. This class includes materials which are sensitive to mechanical or localized thermal shock at normal temperatures and pressures.\tClass 3 \u2013 Materials which are capable of detonation or of explosive decomposition or explosive reaction, but which require a strong initiating source or which must be heated under confinement before initiation. This class includes materials which are sensitive to thermal or mechanical shock at raised temperatures and pressures.\tClass 2 \u2013 Materials which are normally unstable and readily undergo violent chemical change but do not detonate. This class includes materials which can undergo chemical change with rapid release of energy at normal temperatures and pressures, or which can undergo violent chemical change at raised temperatures\u00a0 and pressures.\tClass 1 \u2013 Materials which are normally stable, but which can become unstable at raised temperatures and pressures.\tUpper Flammable Limit \u2013 The maximum concentration of a flammable gas, vapor or dust that will form an ignitable mixture with air at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.\tVapor Pressure \u2013 The pounds per square inch of the vapor when in equilibrium with the liquid which produces the vapor. Vapor pressure shall be determined in accordance with L.A.F.D. Standard No. 36.\tVery High Fire Hazard Severity Zone \u2013 Any area within the City of Los Angeles that poses a significant threat of fire from adjoining natural brush hillside areas and which is determined by the following factors: topography, infrastructure, fire protection, population density, types of construction, weather, existing fire codes and ordinances, and fire history.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 176,943, Eff. 10\/5\/05.)\tWater Reactive Material \u2013 Any material which may produce a violent or dangerous reaction when in contact with water.\tWater Wash Spray Booth \u2013 A spray booth equipped with a water-washing system designed to minimize dust or residues entering exhaust ducts and to permit the recovery of overspray finishing material.\tWeeds \u2013 Plants which are defined as follows:\t1.\tPlants which bear seeds of a downy or wingy nature.\t2.\tPlants which are noxious or dangerous.\t3.\tPoison oak when the conditions of its growth are such as to constitute a menace to public health.\t4.\tAnnual grasses or other flammable vegetation which endangers public safety by creating a fire hazard.\tWelding Cart \u2013 An approved assembly consisting of a frame on which a cylinder of flammable gas and a cylinder of oxygen or air are attached together with regulators, hose, and torches.\tWork Area \u2013 That space within a building occupied by one working person including the bench, machines, or other operating equipment and the supply of hazardous materials or plastics which are in process, awaiting process, or finished.","type":"section","prefixes":[""],"prefix":"","entire_prefix":"","prefix_anchor":"","level":1}}}
