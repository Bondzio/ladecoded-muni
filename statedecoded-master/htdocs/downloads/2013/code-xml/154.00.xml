	It is the purpose of the provisions of this section to provide a property management training program to instruct property owners on how to improve the management of their properties.&#xA0; Substandard building owners and managers are not equipped to properly manage these properties.&#xA0; The training will encompass marketing, preparing units for rental, repair and maintenance of the property, techniques on early detection of drug and gang activity on the property and the use of rental agreements and leases to enforce house rules for proper management.

	Owners who received substandard orders because of a multitude of habitability violations or because they have not complied with a Department of Building and Safety Order to Comply will benefit from the program because these owners often lack expertise and experience in managing these properties.

	Further, some owners need to recognize that property ownership is a business enterprise and in order to stay in business, the properties will have to be managed as a business.&#xA0; Property management training will be beneficial to achieve this goal.

	Based on the foregoing reasons, the City Council finds that a property management training program will improve the management of the rental units in the City of Los Angeles thereby resulting in better managed housing stock.</full_text><order_by>00</order_by><text><unit id="712" prefix=""><text>&#xA0; DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
