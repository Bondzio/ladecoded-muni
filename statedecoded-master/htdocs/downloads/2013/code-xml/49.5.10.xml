	5.	No lobbyist or lobbying firm shall act as an agent or intermediary in the making of any gifts or arrange for the making of any gift by another person to any City official.

	6.	The provisions of Subdivision 3 of this subsection do not apply to foreign gifts made to an officer or employee of the City when representing the Department of Airports or the Harbor Department, which gift is disclosed by that official to the City Ethics Commission within 30 days after receipt on a form prescribed by the Commission.

	7.	For the purpose of this subsection, the term &#x201C;gift&#x201D; does not include:

	(a)	Items received by a City official which are not kept but which are turned over to the City within 30 days after their receipt.

	8.	A City official may request the City Ethics Commission to provide that official with written advice concerning the legality of accepting any specific gift.&#xA0; Such request shall contain sufficient information to allow the Commission or its staff to properly consider the matter.&#xA0; The Commission or its staff shall provide written advice in response to such a request within 10 working days after the Commission&#x2019;s receipt of the request.

	B.	Restrictions on Travel Advances and Reimbursements.

	5.	Travel expenses subject to the prohibitions of this subsection include expenses for intrastate travel and lodging related to a City official&#x2019;s speaking at an event, participating in a seminar or providing similar services, notwithstanding the provisions of Title 2, California Code of Regulations, Section 18728, or any successor section.
