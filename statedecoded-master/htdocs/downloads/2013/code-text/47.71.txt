PURPOSE. (§ 47.71)

  PURPOSE.	It is the purpose of this ordinance to benefit the general public by
minimizing the adverse impact on the housing supply and on displaced low-income,
elderly, and disabled persons, which results from the loss of residential hotel
units through conversion and demolition.  This is to be accomplished by
establishing the status of residential hotel units, by regulating the demolition
and conversion of these units to other uses, and by establishing appropriate
administrative and judicial remedies.
