No. 157,035, Eff. 10\/4\/82.)\n\n\t(a)\t(Amended by Ord. No. 181,882, Eff. 10\/30\/11.)\u00a0 Any person owning or having custody or control of any dog shall pay a license tax of $8.50 for each dog over the age of four months.\u00a0 For spayed females or neutered male dogs, or any dog certified by a licensed veterinarian to be incapable of breeding or being bred, the license tax shall be $3.50.\u00a0 Such license tax shall not apply to any dog kept or maintained exclusively in any licensed dog kennel.\n\n\tThe license tax imposed hereunder shall be due and payable by the owner or custodian of such dog upon acquisition of said dog if the dog is four months of age or older, or once the dog reaches the age of four months, or upon expiration of any previously issued license, or upon notification by the Department that any previously issued license has expired and that such license tax is due and payable.\u00a0 Thereafter, except as otherwise permitted herein, such license tax shall become due and payable by such person on the date of expiration of any license previously issued for such dog.\u00a0 License taxes and fees shall be paid annually or every two or three years on or before the expiration date of a previously issued license.\u00a0 A three year license for an altered dog shall be discounted by $5.00 off the cumulative fee amount due.\n\n\tThe Department is authorized to issue licenses for one, two or three years.\u00a0 The license may have a retroactive start date in order to expire upon the expiration date of the anti-rabies vaccination.\u00a0 The cost of the license shall not be prorated.\u00a0 In the event a license has been previously issued, subsequent licenses shall expire one, two or three years from the date of expiration of such previously issued license.\u00a0 Licenses shall be renewable upon payment of the appropriate license tax.\u00a0 The owner or custodian of a dog may choose the option of paying the license tax for said dog for a period of one, two or three years consistent with State law if such multi-year licenses are offered by the Department.\n\n\tUpon payment of the license tax, the Department shall issue a license and a metal tag with the number thereof, together with the words \u201cL.A. Dog License\u201d plainly inscribed thereon.\u00a0 No portion of the license tax shall be refunded in the event ownership, custody or control of any dog is terminated during the license period or for any other reason.\n\n\tThe metal tag issued with the license shall be a permanent tag and shall be replaced only upon proof of loss or change of ownership.\n\n\tA written certificate, signed by a licensed veterinarian, containing a full description of such dog as to its breed, color, sex, age and name, and reciting the fact that the female dog has been spayed or the male dog neutered or reciting the reasons why the veterinarian otherwise deems the dog described therein incapable of breeding or being bred, shall be exhibited to the person issuing a license in order to qualify for the lower tax and fee specified herein.\u00a0 The General Manager may accept other satisfactory evidence of spaying or neutering in lieu of such certificate where it is unavailable, or when provided in a manner prescribed by the Department, including but not limited to electronic transmission or facsimile, consistent with State law.\n\n\t(b)\tThe Department may issue a free license for any dog duly and properly trained to aid or assist any person who is blind, deaf or physically handicapped when the dog is actually being used to aid or assist such blind, deaf, or physically handicapped person.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 162,486, Eff. 7\/18\/87.)\n\n\t(c)\tProvided, that the Department may transfer without charge the license for any dog exchanged through provisions of Subsection (i) of Section 53.11, unless pursuant to Subsection (a) of this section, the licensed tax charged for a dog taken in exchange for one brought back to the Department would be higher, in which case the license may be transferred only upon the payment of the additional amount.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 142,491, Operative 10\/1\/71.)\n\n\t(d)\t(Amended by Ord.

No. 150,817, Eff. 6\/10\/78, Oper. 7\/1\/78.)\n\n\t(f)\t(Amended by Ord.

No. 181,882, Eff. 10\/30\/11.)\n\n\t(h)\tLate fees.\u00a0 If the license tax imposed hereunder is not paid within 30 days of the time required hereunder, a late fee of $20.00 for a sterilized dog or $100.00 for an unsterilized or intact dog or such other amount as determined by the Board of Animal Services Commissioners and approved by the City Council, shall be due and payable in addition to any other civil or criminal penalties imposed by this Article.\u00a0 A $25.00 field collection fee or such other amount as determined by the Board of Animal Services Commissioners and approved by the City Council, shall be due and payable when the tax for a license is collected at the property where the dog or dogs are maintained following previous notice to the owner by the Department.\u00a0 (Added by Ord. No. 181,882, Eff. 10\/30\/11.)\n\n\t(i)\tThe owner of any dog that has not been spayed or neutered and meets one of the exemptions in Section 53.15.2(b)(2) shall pay a license tax equal to that of an intact dog.\u00a0 In the absence of such immediate proof of exemption, the owner shall enter into an agreement with the Department to provide proof that the dog is exempt and is or will be in compliance with Subdivisions (3) and (4) of Section 53.15.2(b), or have the dog spayed or neutered and provide satisfactory proof to the Department within 60 days that the dog is exempt in compliance with Section 53.15.2(b) or that the dog has been spayed or neutered.\u00a0 Failure to provide the required proof shall subject the dog owner or custodian to the penalties enumerated in Section 53.15.2(b)(7).\u00a0 The license shall not be valid until such satisfactory proof is provided to the Department.\u00a0 No portion of the license tax shall be refunded in the event the dog is spayed or neutered during the license period.\u00a0 (Added by Ord.
