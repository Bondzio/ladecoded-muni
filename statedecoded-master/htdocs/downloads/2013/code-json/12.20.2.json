The provisions of this section shall not apply to developments which do not need locally issued coastal development permits under the Coastal Act of 1976 or the California Coastal Commission Regulations, Division 5.5 Title 14 of the California Administrative Code. A current copy of these regulations is on file with the Department of City Planning and the Office of City Engineer.

Appeals from the approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of a permit under the provisions of this section, may be taken by the applicant or any aggrieved person as follows:\n\n\t1.\tWhere a Coastal Development Permit hearing has been combined with the hearing on the project itself, an appeal may be taken to the appellate body that would hear and decide the appeal from the underlying project. If the appeal from any underlying project is further appealable to a second appellate body, the Coastal Development Permit is likewise further appealable. The time within which to appeal shall be the same as that provided for an appeal of the project itself, but the decision of the permit granting authority on the coastal permit may be separately appealed, without appealing the action on the underlying project. The times for notification of hearing and action on such appeal shall be the same as for the underlying project, whether or not such underlying project is also appealed.\n\n\t2.\tWhere a Coastal Development Permit application is for a public project, the action of the City Engineer may be appealed to the Board of Public Works.

If no timely appeal is taken from the City\u2019s decision to deny a permit, such decision is final.\n\n\tNeither an applicant nor any other aggrieved party may appeal the approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of any permit to the Regional Commission unless and until all of the City\u2019s appeal procedures for such permit have been taken, and a decision thereon has been made.\n\n\tJ.\tRevocation. Any permit application filed or approved under the provisions of this section or Code may be immediately terminated or revoked by the permit granting authority upon a finding that one or more of the following grounds exist:\n\n\t1.\tThat inaccurate, erroneous or incomplete information was filed or presented in conjunction with said Permit application.\n\n\t2.\tThat names and addresses of all property owners as shown on the records of the City Engineer or of the County Assessor, were not provided within the required radius of the involved property in conformity with the requirements of this section and Code.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

However, upon initiation of the project approval process by the applicant, said applicant shall sign and notarize a form prescribed for this purpose which shall contain the following:\n\n\t1.\tA statement advising the applicant that no permits or permission for a Development in the Coastal Zone shall be issued unless and until a Permit has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n\t2.\tA statement relieving the City of any legal or other responsibility in the event that failure to apply for a Permit results in, or contributes to, a violation of Section 65950, 65951 or 65952 of the California Government Code.\n\n\tL.\tViolations. Any violation of the provisions of this section and Code relating to the processing of permits shall be subject to enforcement and penalties of Chapter 9 of the California Coastal Act of 1976 and subsequent amendments thereto.\n\n\tM.\tCharges For Notification.
