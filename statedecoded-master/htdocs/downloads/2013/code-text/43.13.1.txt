VISITING GAMBLING ROOMS. (§ 43.13.1)

  VISITING GAMBLING ROOMS.	No person shall resort to, attend or be in any
house, room or other place where there is any gambling device, equipment or
paraphernalia, which place is barred, barricaded, built or protected in such a
manner as to make ingress or access difficult to police officers.	A
substantially similar ordinance was held not in violation of any constitutional
privileges nor unreasonable or oppressive because of infringement upon personal
rights. “Barred and Barricaded” do not include ordinary private residences
or rooms where doors are locked or bolted in the ordinary method.
	Matter of Ah Chung, 136 Cal. 678 CR A 3440.
