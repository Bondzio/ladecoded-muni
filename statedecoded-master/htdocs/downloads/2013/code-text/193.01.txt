ANNUAL FEE ADJUSTMENTS. (§ 193.01)

  ANNUAL FEE ADJUSTMENTS.	A.	Beginning July 1, 2000, all fees imposed by the
Solid Waste Enforcement Program shall be adjusted annually on July 1 by an
inflation factor (‘IN’), which is based upon the change, from the
COMMENCEMENT DATE to the adjustment date in question, in the Consumer Price
Index for all urban consumers for the Los Angeles Anaheim Riverside Metropolitan
Area (‘CPI-U’) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S.
Department of Labor.	The inflation factor shall be equal to:	IN = [ (CPI-Ua) /
(CPI-UC) ]	where	CPI-Ua = the CPI-U for the calendar month ‘a’; and	‘a’
= the calendar month in which the anniversary of the COMMENCEMENT DATE
occurs;	‘CPI-UC’ = the CPI-U for the calendar month and year in which the
COMMENCEMENT DATE occurs.	B.	Until the final CPI-Ua is published for the year in
question, an estimate of the CPI-Ua shall be made by the City using linear
extrapolation from the prior year’s CPI-Ua to the most recently published
final CPI-U.  The City shall adjust the fee payment for the month following the
publication of the final CPI-Ua to account for any over or under payments
resulting from the use of the estimated CPI-Ua.	C.	Notwithstanding the
calculation methodology described herein, at no time shall IN exceed 0.03 (three
percent) in any single annual adjustment.  If the CPI exceeds 3%, calculated at
an average for a given year, the operating fee will adjust to 75% of the average
CPI in excess of the 3% per year limit to begin the following year.	D.	All fees
contained in the Solid Waste Facility Fee Table in Section 193.02 of this
ordinance are subject to annual fee adjustments as calculated above.
