No. 182,084, Eff. 4\/13\/12.)\n\n\t(a)\tCurfew.\u00a0 It is unlawful for any minor under the age of 18, who is subject to compulsory education or to compulsory continuation education, alone or in concert with others, to be present in or upon the public streets, highways, roads, alleys, parks, playgrounds, or other public grounds, public places, public buildings, places or amusement and eating places, vacant lots or any place open to the public during the hours of the day when the school, which the minor would normally attend, is in session, on days when that school is in session.\u00a0 This section shall not apply to public sidewalks immediately adjacent to school grounds, the entrance areas to schools, or to school grounds.\n\n\t(b)\tExceptions.\u00a0 The provisions of this section shall not apply when:\n\n\t(1)\tThe minor is accompanied by his or her parent, guardian, or other adult person authorized by the parent or guardian having the care or custody of the minor; or\n\n\t(2)\tThe minor is on an emergency errand directed by his or her parent, guardian or other adult person having the care or custody of the minor; or\n\n\t(3)\tThe minor is attending or going

school, regardless of whether school has already begun.\u00a0 If the minor is contacted by law enforcement within a 3 block radius of his or her school within the first 60 minutes after school has begun, it establishes a rebuttable presumption that the minor is traveling to his or her school.\n\n\t(c)\tEnforcement.\u00a0 Before taking any action to enforce the provisions of this section, police officers shall ask the apparent offender\u2019s age and reason for being in the public place during curfew hours.\u00a0 The officer shall not issue a citation or make an arrest under this section

directly on the citation.\n\n\t(d)\tPenalties for Violation.\u00a0 A violation of this section is an infraction.\u00a0 The first and second violations of this section shall only be punishable by either a requirement to provide an attendance plan to the court, developed with the minor and\/or parent or appropriate guardian, or to participate in community service or other appropriate community or school-based program for mentoring, tutoring, credit recovery, or counseling.\u00a0 The minor shall not be required to perform community service or fulfill program attendance for a total time exceeding 20 hours in any 60-day period, and the hours for performance shall occur during times other than during the minor\u2019s hours of school attendance or employment.\n\n\tThird and subsequent violations of this section shall be punishable by the sanctions for a first or second violation, or may be punishable by a fine not exceeding twenty dollars ($20.00) for any individual minor.\u00a0 At any time, fines may be waived due to indigence.\n\n\t(e)\tSeverability of Provisions.\u00a0 If any severable provision of this ordinance or any application thereof is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the ordinance which can be given effect notwithstanding such invalidity.","order_by":"04","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"72","name":"Minors","identifier":"5","label":"article","url":"\/4\/5\/"},"2":{"id":"11","name":"Public
