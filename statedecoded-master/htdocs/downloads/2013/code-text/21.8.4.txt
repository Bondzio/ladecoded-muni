                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

RETAILER REMITS QUARTERLY. (§ 21.8.4)

  RETAILER REMITS QUARTERLY.	Each retailer selling cigarettes within the City
of Los Angeles shall collect the tax imposed under Sec. 21.8.2 of this article,
and on or before the last day of the month following the close of a calendar
quarter remit the total amount so collected to the Director of Finance, together
with a statement on a form provided by the Director of Finance showing the
number of cigarettes sold to purchasers, the amount of tax collected, and such
other information as the Director of Finance shall require. Where the Director
of Finance determines that efficiency in the administration of the tax would be
promoted, he may establish reporting periods greater than quarterly, but not to
exceed one year. The Director of Finance may establish shorter reporting periods
for any retailer if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the
tax. Statements and payments are due immediately upon cessation of the business
of selling cigarettes for any reason. All taxes collected by retailers pursuant
to this article shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment
thereof is made to the Director of Finance.
