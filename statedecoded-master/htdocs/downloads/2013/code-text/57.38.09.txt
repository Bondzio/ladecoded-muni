inside of any building while any tank or compartment thereof is being loaded or
unloaded, provided, however, that a tank vehicle may be located under a canopy

Deviation from this requirement shall be permitted only when a competent person
stands at the rear of the vehicle and aids the driver in safely backing
up.	C.	Whenever practicable, tank vehicles being unloaded into tanks shall be so
positioned that the operating controls and unloading end of the hose are both in
view of the operator.	D.	Tank vehicles shall be loaded at an approved bulk
distributing station.	EXCEPTIONS:	1.	When such tank vehicle is disabled through
accident or mechanical failure and it is necessary to remove the fuel cargo,
such cargo may be transferred to another tank vehicle.	2.	When such tank vehicle
is used for removing products from a waste oil tank or other facility containing
combustible liquids having a flash point of 200° F. or more.	3.	When such tank
vehicle loading operation is performed under Permit from the Department pursuant
to Division 5 of this article.
