	7.	(Former Subdiv. 6 Renumbered by Ord. No 168,533, Eff. 3/1/93.) &#xA0; Where payment was made per Section 64.18 and thereafter a public sewer is constructed to serve such property and the property is assessed for the construction thereof, the claim must be filed within one year from the date notice is mailed to the last address of the owner of the land that the City Council has confirmed the final assessments for said sewer.

No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)

	(c)	Where a refund is due under the provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section or a&#xA0; refund credit is due pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (e) of this Section and the refund or refund credit does not exceed the sum of $25,000, the Board is authorized to make such refund or refund credit without the necessity of first receiving the approval of the City Council, and is authorized to cause a demand to be drawn on the general fund or any other fund in which the fees being refunded may have been deposited.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)

	(d)	The provisions of this section shall not relieve any person from compliance with the provisions of Sections 363, 376 and 376.1 of the Charter relating to the presentation of claims prior to the bringing of a suit or action thereon, or be deemed to limit or qualify the lawful right of any person to bring or maintain any action or proceeding based upon the general law of this State for any remedy provided by that law.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 146,426, Eff. 9/22/74.)

	3.	The flow, as determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 64.11.3(f), from the property is less than the amount for which SFC payment was made;

	4.	The SIU can demonstrate that the reduced amount of flow identified in Subdivision 3. of this Subsection was caused by the use of water conservation practices, pretreatment of discharge, or use of environmentally responsible practices; and

	5.	The SIU, at the time of submission of the written claim to the City Clerk required by the provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section, is not delinquent in payment of any monies owed pursuant to any provision of this Article or Article 4.1.

	(f)	The monetary value of a refund credit that may be offset against QSF fees as authorized pursuant to Subsection (e) of this Section shall be calculated based on the rate at which the fees for which a refund is requested were paid.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)

	(g)	Any refund credit that is used pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (e) of this Section to offset QSF fees will be removed from property records, and any future fee required for the property pursuant to the provisions of Section 64.11.2 or Section 64.16.1 will be calculated based on the rates in effect at the time the fee is imposed.&#xA0; (Added by Ord.
