PURPOSE. (§ 91.9301)

  PURPOSE.
	(Added by Ord. No. 172,018, Eff. 5/21/98.)	The purpose of this division is to
promote the public welfare and safety by reducing the risk of death or injury
that may result from the effects of earthquakes on existing wood-frame
multi-unit residential buildings. The ground motion of the Northridge Earthquake
caused the loss of human life, personal injury and property damage in these
types of buildings. This division creates minimum standards to strengthen the
more vulnerable portions of these structures. When fully followed, these minimum
standards will substantially improve the performance of these buildings but will
not necessarily prevent all earthquake related damage.
