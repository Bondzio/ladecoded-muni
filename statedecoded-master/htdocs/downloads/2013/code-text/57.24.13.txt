RATE OF DISCHARGE. (§ 57.24.13)

  RATE OF DISCHARGE.	The rate of discharge of a fumigant into a building, ship,
or any subdivision thereof shall not exceed that flow which will create a
gas-air mixture equal to 50 percent of its lower flammable limit in the smallest
subdivision into which it is being introduced. Application of the fumigant under
the first floor of a structure, whether through a spray nozzle or through
vaporizing equipment shall be intermittent so that the flow will not permit
formation of gas-air mixture within its flammable range, except in the area
immediately surrounding the point of application.
