  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VACANT BUILDINGS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)91.8813.1.  General.  This
section shall apply to every vacant unreinforced masonry bearing wall building
within the scope of this division which has not complied with the requirements
contained in this division.91.8813.2.  Enforcement.  When the Department
determines that a building is within the scope of this section, it shall notify
the owner and order the owner to bring the building into compliance with the
provisions of this section  Compliance with such an order shall be accomplished
within the time limits set forth herein and any extensions of time granted by
the Department.  If the owner does not comply within such time limits, then the
Department may order the demolition of the building or structure in accordance
with the provisions of Section 91.8903.91.8813.3  Time for Compliance. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)	1.	For a one-story building with
wall anchors installed pursuant to Section 91.8808.3, either before or within 60
days after notice is given by the Department:	Within 180 days after notice is
given pursuant to this section, the owner shall submit to the Department either
plans and a structural analysis for the proposed structural alterations of the
building necessary to comply with the minimum requirements of this division, or
an application for demolition of the building or structure.	If the owner elects
to perform the proposed structural alterations, then within 270 days after
notice is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall obtain the necessary
permits for strengthening the building or structure; within 90 days of obtaining
a permit to strengthen the building, the owner shall commence strengthening
work; and within 18 months after notice is given pursuant to this section, the
owner shall complete all strengthening work.	If the owner elects to demolish the
building, then within 210 days after notice is given pursuant to this section,
the owner shall obtain permits for the demolition of the building or structure;
within 21 days of obtaining a demolition permit, the owner shall commence
demolition; and within 300 days after notice is given pursuant to this section
the owner shall complete the demolition of the building or structure.	2.	Time
for compliance for all other buildings:	Within 60 days after notice is given
pursuant to this section, the owner shall submit to the Department either plans
and a structural analysis for the proposed structural alterations of the
building necessary to comply with the minimum requirements of this division, or
an application for demolition of the building or structure.	If the owner elects
to perform the necessary alterations, then within 120 days after notice is given
pursuant to this section, the owner shall obtain the necessary permits for
strengthening the building or structure; within 21 days of obtaining a permit,
the owner shall begin work; and within 365 days after notice is given pursuant
to this section, the owner shall complete all strengthening work.	If the owner
elects to perform the necessary alterations, then within 120 days after notice
is given pursuant to this section, the owner shall obtain the necessary permits
for strengthening the building or structure; and within 120 days after obtaining
the demolition permit, the owner shall complete the demolition of the building
or structure.91.8813.4.  Special Provisions for Damaged Buildings.  An
unreinforced masonry bearing wall building which is damaged or partially
destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or other calamity or act of God or
the public enemy shall be repaired or demolished within six months of such
damage or destruction.	DEMAND-CAPACITY RATIO, 0.33 WD/(2vuD)  OR  0.33

depth ratio of 5 to 1 or greater, the value shall be increased by 50
percent.	3.	For flexible and flexible mounted equipment and machinery, the
appropriate values for Cp shall be determined with consideration given to both
the dynamic properties of the equipment and machinery and to the building and
building or structure in which it is placed.	4.	The Wp for storage racks shall
be the weight of the racks plus contents.  The value of Cp for racks over two
storage support levels in height shall be 0.16 for the levels below the top two
levels.	5.	The design of the equipment and machinery and their anchorage is an
integral part of the design and specification of that equipment and machinery. 
The structure to which the equipment or machinery is mounted shall be capable of
resisting the anchorage forces (see also Section 13.6.5 of ASCE-7).  (Amended

diaphragms shall be designed for a minimum force resulting from a Cp of 0.12
applied to Wp unless a greater force results from the distribution of lateral

to buildings of Rating Classification I. Walls of buildings within Rating
Classification I shall be analyzed in accordance with Section 91.8808.6 of this
Code.	3.	The minimum mortar shear strengths required in Footnotes 4 and 5 shall
be that shear strength without the effect of axial stress in the wall at the
point of the test.	4.	The larger height-to-thickness ratio may be used where
mortar shear tests in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of this Code establish
a minimum mortar shear strength of not less than 100 psi (690 kPa) or where the
tested mortar shear strength is not less than 60 psi (414 kPa) and a visual
examination of the vertical wythe-to-wythe wall joint (collar joint) indicates
not less than 50 percent mortar coverage.	5.	Where a visual examination of the
collar joint indicates not less than 50 percent mortar coverage and the minimum
mortar shear strength when established in accordance with Section 91.8809.5.3 of
this Code is greater than 30 psi (207 kPa) but less than 60 psi (414 kPa), the
allowable height-to-thickness ratio may be determined by linear interpolation
between the larger and smaller ratios in direct proportion to the mortar shear
strength.
