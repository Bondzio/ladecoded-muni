and LAFD Standard No. 68 shall regulate all atmospheric tanks which are
incorporated as an integral part of a transfer or process system used for
handling or storing hazardous substances.  Such provisions provide necessary
safeguards to carry out the purpose and intent of this division.  Whenever the
term “tank” is used in this division, it shall mean “atmospheric
tank”.  If a conflict arises between LAFD Standard No. 68 and the provisions
of this division, the more restrictive shall apply.	EXCEPTION:	The provisions of
these sections shall not include structures such as clarifiers, sumps,
separators, storm drains, catch basins, lagoons, evaporation ponds, well
cellars, separation sumps, lined or unlined pits, or final interceptors in
industrial waste pretreatment systems.
