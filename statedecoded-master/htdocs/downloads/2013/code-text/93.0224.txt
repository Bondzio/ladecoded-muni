  FEE FOR MISCELLANEOUS PERMIT
	(Amended by Ord. No 166,524, Eff. 1/29/91.)	(a)	The fee for any electric wiring
for which a permit is required, but for which no fee is provided herein, shall
be as specified in 98.0412(c), provided, however, that no such fee shall be
charged when a fee is paid for one or more outlets, fixtures, motors, appliances
or other equipment.  The fee is in addition to the permit fee under Subsection
(b) of Section 93.0213.	(b)	When special permission has been obtained from the
Department, a miscellaneous permit may be issued for electrical raceways, and
enclosures which are to be installed in the ground or masonry floors or
installations, where an electrical permit cannot be issued until the required
plans have been approved.  This special permission shall not include permission
to install any raceways, enclosures, wiring, or devices of any description
related to a fire alarm, or life safety system until those specific system plans
have been approved and permits have been issued.  The miscellaneous permit
shall not be an authorization to install any additional wiring other than the
specified raceways and enclosures.	A miscellaneous inspection fee as specified
in Section 98.0412(c) of this Code shall be paid for the inspection and shall be
limited to one inspection and one reinspection trip.  This fee is in addition
to the permit fee specified in Subsection 93.0213(b) of this Code.
