  LANDLORD’S OPTIONS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,074, Eff. 6/23/96.)	A.	Upon receipt of the notification
of hearing, the landlord may take the following steps:	1.	Submit proof to the
Department that the alleged habitability violation has been corrected.  In this
event, the Department shall cancel the proposed hearing unless the tenant
challenges the accuracy of the proof filed by the landlord.  If there is a
tenant challenge, then the Department shall independently verify that the
violation has been corrected prior to canceling the hearing.	2.	(Amended by Ord.
No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)  Request the Department to conduct an inspection. 
This inspection shall be conducted by referral of the complaint for inspection
pursuant to Section 161.602.  If the inspection reveals that the violation has
been repaired or never existed, then the Department shall cancel the proposed
hearing.  If the results of the inspection support the finding that the
habitability violation alleged in the complaint continues to exist, then that
evidence shall be submitted to the General Manager at the time of the hearing
along with any other evidence supplied by the tenant or the landlord.	3.	Attend
the hearing and provide evidence which indicates that a habitability violation
does not exist.	B.	The notice to the landlord required by Subsection B of
Section 153.03 shall set forth these options.
