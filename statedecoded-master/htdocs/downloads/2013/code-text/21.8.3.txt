TAX PAID TO THE RETAILER. (§ 21.8.3)

  TAX PAID TO THE RETAILER.	The tax constitutes a debt owed by the purchaser to
the City which is extinguished only by payment of the tax to the Director of
Finance or to the retailer. When a purchase from a retailer is made within the
City the tax shall be paid to the retailer at the time the purchase price is
paid. The tax collected or required to be collected by the retailer constitutes
a debt owed by the retailer to the City. Should any remittance of tax be made by
a retailer prior to sale of cigarettes to a consumer, such remittance shall be
considered as an advance payment to be reimbursed by adding the amount of the
tax to the price of the cigarettes at the time of sale to the user or consumer.
