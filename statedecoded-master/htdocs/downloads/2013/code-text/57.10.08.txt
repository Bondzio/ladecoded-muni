EXITS. (§ 57.10.08)

  EXITS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 168,176, Eff. 9/20/92.)	A.	The asbestos abatement process
shall not cause a building to have an amount of exiting less than that required
for the existing occupant load.  In all cases where the required exiting must
be obstructed, an alternate means of exiting must be provided which is approved
by the Fire Department and the Department of Building and Safety.	B.	A minimum
of two clearly marked exits shall be maintained from each floor during the
abatement process.  The second exit from a containment area may be covered with
plastic upon approval of the Fire Department and the Department of Building and
Safety.	The covered exit shall be outlined with RED duct-type tape, and a
cutting device shall be kept immediately adjacent to the door in an obvious and
readily accessible location.  The cutting device shall also be surrounded by a
square of red duct-type tape as described above.	C.	At no time shall the
asbestos abatement process involve, block, impede, or obstruct any stairwell in
a multistory building.  Any asbestos abatement plan involving any stairwell
must be approved by the field inspector before commencing work on that
stairwell.	D.	At least one stairwell door shall open into a noncontaminated area
of a floor under containment, regardless of the size of containment.
