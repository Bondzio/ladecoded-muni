STATEMENT OF POLICY. (§ 49.70)

  STATEMENT OF POLICY.

	Discrimination based on sexual orientation exists in the City of Los Angeles.
Such discrimination foments strife, unrest and discord and deprives the City of
the fullest utilization of its resources and capacity for development and
advancement. Such discrimination poses a substantial threat to the health,
safety and welfare of the community and existing state and federal restraints on
arbitrary discrimination are inadequate to meet the particular problems of this
City.
