No. 182,076, Eff. 4\/6\/12.)\t(g)\tSewage Volume:\u00a0 The volume of sewage discharged from a premises, used for the purposes of calculating the Sewer Service Charge, shall be determined as follows, unless the Board has authorized an adjustment pursuant to Subsection (b) of Section 64.41.07:\t(1)\tFor residential users, the volume for each day billed to a user on a premises within a fiscal year shall be the greater of the following:\t(A)\tthe Winter Water Use for that user on that premises during the most recently determined Rainy Season Review Period multiplied by the corresponding Dry Winter Compensation Factor; or\t(B)\tthe minimum reasonable volume of sewage discharged by a household consisting of one resident as determined by the Board.\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 If the volume of water delivered to a premises during a billing period is zero, the volume of sewage discharged shall be zero. The Board shall establish rules to estimate the volume of sewage discharged when the record of data for a user on a premises during the most recently determined rainy season is incomplete or nonexistent.(Amended by Ord. No. 172,763, Eff. 9\/19\/99.) \u00a0\t(2)\tFor Commercial, Governmental, Multiple Dwelling, and Industrial users, the volume shall be the volume of water supplied to the premises during the billing period multiplied by the Default Percentage Discharge.\u00a0 The Board shall annually adjust the Default Percentage Discharge based, in whole or in part, on Department of Water and Power Water conservation policies, to reflect the amount of flow discharged to the sewer system by commercial, governmental, multiple dwelling, and industrial users, but in no event shall the Default Percentage Discharge be less than 90% or exceed 94%.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4\/6\/12.)\t(3)\tDirect Measurement\/Calculation:\tA.\tIn lieu of paragraphs (1) or (2) above, the Board may authorize the direct measurement or calculation of the volume of sewage discharged from a premises in the following circumstances:\ti.\tWhere in the Board\u2019s judgement, the flows of sewage from the premises are sufficient for accurate measurement, any user may obtain a permit from the Board and install a device or devices approved by the Board to measure all the sewage discharged into the sewer system from the premises.\u00a0 For purposes of this article, the total aggregate sewage measured through said device or devices sharing a given billing period will be deemed to be the sewage volume discharged from the premises for said billing period.\tii.\tWhere the plumbing on a premises has been arranged to isolate the plumbing which serves uses that are tributary to the sewer from the uses not so tributary, subject to inspection and approval by the Department of Building and Safety (DBS), a user may obtain Board authority to install one private water meter for each tributary City water meter serving the premises.\u00a0 When the private meter is installed on the tributary service, the Sewer Service Charge shall be billed based on the volume of water through the private meter during the billing period.\u00a0 When the private meter is installed on the non-tributary service, the Sewer Service Charge shall be billed based on the difference between the volume through the City meter and the private meter during the billing period.\u00a0 A user may allow hose bibbs to remain attached to the tributary service, but no credit against the Sewer Service Charge shall be given in such a case.\u00a0 The Board shall promulgate rules which determine whether the meter is to be installed on the tributary or non-tributary service.\tA user may choose at any time to revert to volume determination based on the methods in Paragraphs (1) or (2) above, whichever is applicable; however, such a user may not again be approved for private metering before 12 months have elapsed since the effective date of reversion.\tThe Board may require the user at any time to install a device to telemeter the data obtained by the metering device back to a City computer if the installed meter allows for this to be done.\tB.\tWhenever the Board has authorized the direct measurement or calculation of sewage volume discharged from a premises, the user shall bear all responsibility for the expense of permits, equipment, installation, and maintenance of any private water meter.\u00a0 The Board may require periodic testing of installed equipment to insure reasonable accuracy.\u00a0 The board may revert a user who does not repair malfunctioning equipment within the time which the Board may specify to volume determination based on the methods in paragraphs (1) or (2)\u00a0 above, whichever is applicable.\t(h)\tLow-Income Subsidy:\u00a0 The Sewer Service Charge shall be reduced by 31% for low-income Residential users who pay such charges, the definition of such a class being determined by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners, subject to verification by the Director of Sanitation, for the first 18 billing units (a billing unit being each hcf of sewage entering the sewer system) of each two-month billing period, or the first nine billing units for each one-month billing period as to any such Residential user billed monthly.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4\/6\/12.)\t(i)\tLow-Income Subsidy Surcharge:\u00a0 The Sewer Service Charge to all users, who are not within the class of a low-income Residential user, as provided in Subsection (h), shall be increased by a surcharge of 0.84%.\t(j)\tThe sewer service charge for the volume of sewage introduced into the sewer system from any property not supplied with water by Water and Power will be determined by the Board and shall be as nearly as possible equivalent to the sewer service charge established under this section for similar property supplied with water from Water and Power.\t(k)\tThe Board shall have the power and duty, and is hereby directed to enforce all of the provisions of this article, except as otherwise set forth herein, and shall provide such rules and regulations as are consistent with the provisions of this article and as may be necessary or desirable to aid in the administration, including adjustments. and enforcement of the sewer service charge.\t(l)\tThe Board or any of its authorized representatives may make such inspections or investigations as said Board deems necessary at any reasonable time in any building, premises or lot for any of the purposes set forth in this article. No person shall interfere with, prevent or refuse to permit the entry of said Board or any of its authorized representatives into or upon any building, premises or lot for any of the purposes set forth in this article.\t(1)\tTo determine the size, depth and location of the sewer or storm drain connection;\t(2)\tTo determine the outlet of an sewer or storm drain connection by depositing testing materials in any plumbing fixture attached thereto and flushing the same, if necessary;\t(3)\tTo determine by measurements and samples the quantity of sewage or waste water being discharged into any sewer, storm drain or water course;\t(4)\tTo inspect, test and sample the discharge of any device used to prevent the discharge into any sewer, storm drain, or water course of illegal waste or illegal quantities of waste, such as floor drains, sand boxes, grease traps or other clarifiers, also, of those devices used to grind, shred, pulverize, or otherwise treat garbage or industrial waste before discharging same into a sewer or storm drain.\t(5)\tTo determine the location of roof, swimming pool and surface drains, and whether they are connected to a street gutter, storm drain or sewer.\t(6)\tTo determine the nature and quantity of flow in any open water course or storm drain.","type":"section","prefixes":[""],"prefix":"","entire_prefix":"","prefix_anchor":"","level":1}},"previous_section":{"id":"1940","structure_id":"107","section_number":"64.41.01","catch_line":"Definitions.","url":"\/64.41.01\/","token":"64.41.01"}}
