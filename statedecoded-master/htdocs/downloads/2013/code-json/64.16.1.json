No. 171,036, Eff. 6\/6\/96.)\n\n\t1.\tWhere the Board finds that an applicant presently discharging, as of the date of this ordinance, into the Los Angeles Harbor has been ordered by a State and\/or Federal agency to so cease discharging and, as a result, must therefore connect to the City sewer system, the Board may permit the applicant to defer payment of such sewage facilities charge for a two year period from the date of the application for the sewer connection permit. If at the end of such two year period the property which was connected to the City\u2019s sewer system pursuant to such deferment of payment is no longer so connected no sewerage facilities charge will be imposed. The granting of such deferment of payment is subject to the applicant entering into an agreement to pay the amount deferred if the subject property is still connected to the City\u2019s sewer system at the end of the two year period.\u00a0 (Para. numbered 1., Amended\u00a0 by Ord. No. 153,056, Eff. 10\/29\/79.)\n\n\t2.\t(Added by Ord.

If at the end of such eighteen month extension the property which was connected to the City\u2019s sewer system pursuant to such deferment of payment is no longer so connected no sewerage facilities charge will be imposed. The granting of such extended deferment is subject to the applicant entering into an agreement, or amending its existing agreement, with the City to pay the amount deferred if the subject property is still connected to the City\u2019s sewer system at the end of the eighteen month extension period.\n\n\t(i)\t((h) Relettered (i) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6\/6\/96.)\u00a0 The sewerage facilities charge fees applicable to single family dwellings as of September 1, 1986, shall be applicable to a sewer connection by a single family dwelling to a sewer when:\n\n\t1.\tThe sewer was installed pursuant to an assessment proceeding where the petition therefore was on file with the City as of September 1,1986; and\n\n\t2.\tThe connection is made within one year after acceptance of the completed sewer by the Board.\n\n\t(j)\t((i) Relettered (j) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6\/6\/96.)\u00a0 Where the applicant is a non-profit corporation it shall be exempt from sewerage facilities charges required for a dwelling structure it is constructing, or substantially rehabilitating, to serve low-income elderly and\/or handicapped families or individuals if the construction or rehabilitation of said structure is being government funded and the dwelling is on property being leased from the city, or on property which has been, or will be, acquired from the City with the City having an option to re-acquire the property. A corporation is non-profit, for the purpose of this section, if:\n\n\t(1)\tThe purposes of the corporation include the promotion of the welfare of elderly and\/or handicapped families and\/or individuals;\n\n\t(2)\tNo part of the net earnings of the corporation may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder, contributor or individual; and\n\n\t(3)\tThe corporation is not controlled by, or under the direction of, persons or firms seeking to derive profit or gain therefrom.\n\n\t(k)\t((j) Relettered (k) by Ord.

No. 169,042, Eff. 9\/14\/93.)\u00a0 Where an alcohol retail business was damaged or destroyed in the 1992 civil disturbance, the sewerage facilities charge shall be waived where the specific site, or an area encompassing the specific site, where such business was or is located, is to be converted to another use not involving the sale of alcoholic beverages.\u00a0 In case the new use is to be a non-industrial laundromat, such waiver will be to the extent of the use of a maximum of sixty (60) washing machines; provided, however, if the new use is something other than a laundromat, the waiver available shall be equivalent to the amount of the sewerage facilities charge payable for a laundromat containing sixty (60) washing machines.\u00a0 As a condition to obtaining such a waiver of the sewerage facilities charge, the alcohol retail licensee must submit proof of the cancellation of the license issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Department for the particular alcohol retail business which was damaged or destroyed, at the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.\n\n\tSuch conversion to a new use having occurred, if there should be a further or different conversion then the credit utilized in determining the appropriate sewerage facilities charge shall be based upon the\u00a0 applicable sewerage facilities flow credit prior to the 1992 civil disturbance.\n\n\tThis section shall be non-operative two (2) years after its effective date.\n\n\t(m)\t(Added by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6\/6\/96.)\u00a0 Notwithstanding Subsection (a) of this section, where the application is for the connection of a temporary field office at a construction site to a sewer, no
