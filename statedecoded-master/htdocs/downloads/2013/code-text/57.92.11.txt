STATIC PROTECTION. (§ 57.92.11)

  STATIC PROTECTION.	A.	Every loading rack shall be protected by a metallic
bond wire permanently connected to the fill stem or fill stem piping.  This
conductor shall be stranded wire not smaller than No. 8 A.W.G. (American Wire
Gage).  The free end shall be equipped with a clamp or equivalent device for
attachment to some metallic part of the tank car, tank truck or cargo tank. 
Bond wire connection shall be made prior to opening dome covers, and shall be
maintained in place during the entire filing process.  Dome covers shall be
closed before bond wire is disconnected.  Tank car loading facilities shall be
protected by bonding the pipe riser to at least one rail and to the rack
structure.  Multiple lines entering the rack shall be electrically bonded
together.	B.	Filling through open domes into the tanks of vehicles or tank cars
that contain vapor-air mixtures within the flammable range, or where the liquid
being filled can form such a mixture, shall be by means of a downspout which
extends near the bottom of the tank.
