RESTRAINT. (§ 57.113.10)

  RESTRAINT.	Patients shall not be restrained in any institutional
occupancy.	EXCEPTIONS:	1.	Institutional occupancies licensed and constructed for
such use in accordance with the provisions of Title 24, C.C.R (Amended by Ord.
No. 167,326, Eff. 11/16/91.)	2.	shall not be construed to include non-ambulatory
persons, nor shall it include the use of bandage material, strip sheeting, or
other fabrics or materials, such as soft ties, used to restrain persons in
hospital type beds or wheelchairs with the intention of preventing injury,
provided an approved method of quick release is maintained. A facility employing
the use of soft ties, however, shall be classified as a building used to house
non-ambulatory persons.
