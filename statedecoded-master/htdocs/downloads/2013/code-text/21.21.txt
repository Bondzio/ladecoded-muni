DELINQUENT TAXES – UNCOLLECTIBLE. (§ 21.21)

  DELINQUENT TAXES – UNCOLLECTIBLE.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 141,263, Eff. 12/21/70.)	If the Director of Finance finds
that any amount of tax due or believed to be due under the provisions of this
article or Article 1.5 cannot be collected, or that efforts to collect any such
amount would be disproportionately costly with relation to the probable outcome
of the collecting efforts, he may prepare a report setting forth his finding and
the reasons therefor, and submit it to a Board of Review constituted as provided
in Sec. 21.16 of this Code. Upon unanimous approval of a finding by the Board of
Review, the Director of Finance may remove from his active accounts receivable
any unpaid tax owing or believed to be owing. If the Board of Review does not
unanimously approve the finding, the matter shall be returned to the Director of
Finance. The removal from the active accounts receivable of the Director of
Finance of any unpaid tax as provided herein shall not preclude the City from
collecting or attempting to collect any such tax that later proves to be
collectible.
