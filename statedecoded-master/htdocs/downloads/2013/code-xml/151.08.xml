	A.	In addition to the authority contained in Section 151.07, the Rent Adjustment Commission may make such adjustments, either upward or downward, of the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent for any class of rental units as it determines are appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.&#xA0; For the purposes of this section, the phrase &#x201C;class of rental units&#x201D; may include all rental units or certain categories of rental units based on such common characteristics as the Commission may determine, including size, age, construction, rent, or geographic area.

	B.	The Commission shall promulgate regulations on what constitutes corresponding reductions in rents in those instances where there is a reduction of housing services, and on permissible rent increases where a rental unit regularly experiences a seasonal fluctuation in rents.

	C.	For the purpose of adjusting rents under the provisions of this section, the Commission may promulgate by regulation a schedule of standards for permissible rental increases, or required decreases related to the improvement, reduction, or deterioration in housing services or facilities, or to increases or decreases in operating expenses and taxes.&#xA0; A decrease in operating expenses shall include a reclassification of the rate of the sewer service charge from commercial rates to residential rates for master metered mobilehome park residents.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 168,353, Eff. 1/3/93.)

	D.	The Commission may promulgate regulations extending the amortization period for rent adjustments granted by the Department pursuant to Section 151.07 A. of this chapter, where the capital improvement and/or rehabilitation work has been funded or subsidized through a federal, state or City housing program.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)

	E.	The Commission shall promulgate regulations to determine the appropriate maximum adjusted rent on a rental unit when the tenant of a rental unit was, but no longer is, the resident manager, and when a rental unit, formerly occupied by a resident manager, is offered for rent to another person.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord.
