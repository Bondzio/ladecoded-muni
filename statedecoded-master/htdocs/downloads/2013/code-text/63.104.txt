  CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP – REMOVAL OF PLATES.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 160,677, Eff. 2/22/86.)	In the event of the discontinuance
of ownership by this City of any unit of automobile equipment, it shall be the
duty of the Purchasing Agent, prior to the surrender of such automobile
equipment, to remove or cause to be removed any registration plates assigned to
such unit, and obliterate all identification markings denoting City
ownership.	Provided, however, that if the equipment is inoperative and is being
transferred to another entity solely for art, museum, or cultural display
purposes, the City Council, by motion or by resolution, may direct that
identification markings denoting City ownership including replicas of the City
seal need not be removed therefrom or obliterated.  In such instances the state
motor vehicle registration plates shall be removed.
