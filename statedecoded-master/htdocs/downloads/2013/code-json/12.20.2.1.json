expiration of the appeal period or within any additional period mutually agreed upon by the Applicant and the Commission or Board.\n\n\t4.\tAppellate Decision.\u00a0 The Area Planning Commission or Board of Public Works may reverse or modify the initial decision, in whole or in part.\u00a0 In reversing or modifying the initial decision, the Commission or Board shall make the same findings required to be made by the initial decision-maker and shall indicate why the initial decision-maker erred or abused its discretion.\n\n\tI.\tRecordation of the Coastal Development Permit.\u00a0 Within 14 days of the issuance of the Coastal Development Permit for a Coastal Development subject to the jurisdiction of the Director, the Applicant shall record the Permit with the Los Angeles County

requested notice of the final action by submitting a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the Approving Authority.\u00a0 The notice shall include conditions of approval, written findings, and, if applicable, the procedures for appeal to the Coastal Commission.\n\n\tK.\tNotification of Failure to Act and Approval by Operation of Law.\n\n\t1.\tNotification by Applicant.\u00a0 If the Approving

notify, in writing, the Approving Authority and the Coastal Commission and all persons entitled to receive notice pursuant to Subdivision 2. of Subsection H. of this section that the Coastal Development has been approved by operation of law.\u00a0 The notice shall specify the application which is claimed to have been approved.\n\n\t2.\tNotification by Approving Authority.\u00a0 When the Approving Authority determines that the time limits established pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950- 65957.1 have expired, and that the notice required pursuant to Subdivision 2. of Subsection H. of this section has occurred, the Approving Authority shall, within seven calendar days of its determination, notify any person entitled to receive notice pursuant to Subdivision 2. of Subsection H. of this section that it has taken final action by operation of law pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950-65957.1, and that the application, if it is for an Appealable Development, may be appealed to the Coastal Commission pursuant to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 13110, et seq.\n\n\tL.\tAppeal Procedures for Multiple Applications Including a Coastal Development Permit.\u00a0 The Approving Authority for multiple applications for a Coastal Development Permit and other quasi-judicial or legislative approvals shall be as established in Section 12.36 A. through E.\u00a0 However, the appeal procedures for the consolidated action shall follow the procedural requirements for notice, public hearing and final action of an initial decision on a Coastal Development Permit in accordance with Subsections D., E. and F. of this section.\u00a0\n\n\tM.\tDuration of Permits.\u00a0\n\n\t1.\tValidity.\u00a0 A Coastal Development Permit that was granted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall run with the land and continue to be valid upon any changes of ownership of the land or any changes to the existing building or structure on the land.\n\n\t2.\tTermination.\u00a0 A permit which has not been used within the time specified in\u00a0 the permit, or, if no time is specified, within two years after the granting of the permit, shall become void.\u00a0 The Director or City Engineer, whichever has jurisdiction, may grant extensions of time for the utilization of the permit, provided the extension is requested prior to the expiration date, under the provisions of Subsection O. of this section.\u00a0 In cases where other approvals are granted concurrently with the Coastal Development Permit, the time limits and extensions shall be the same as those for the other approvals.\u00a0 However, the Coastal Development Permit shall become void after six years.\n\n\t3.\tUtilization of Permit.\u00a0 A Coastal Development Permit shall be considered used when construction or other development authorized by that permit, which would be prohibited in that location if no Coastal Development Permit had been issued, has commenced.\u00a0 A Coastal Development Permit shall automatically cease to be in effect if the use for which the permit was granted has ceased or has been suspended for a consecutive period of two or more years.\u00a0\n\n\tN.\tRevocation.\n\n\t1.\tFailure to Comply with Conditions.\u00a0 If the Director or City Engineer, whichever has jurisdiction, determines that the conditions of any Coastal Development Permit granted pursuant to this section have not been complied with, the Director or City Engineer may give notice to the record owner or lessee of the real property to appear at a time and place fixed by the Director or City Engineer and show cause why the determination of the Approving Authority granting the Coastal Development Permit should not be rescinded.\u00a0 An appeal from a revocation action may be taken in the same manner prescribed in Subsection H. of this section.\u00a0\n\n\t2.\tRequest by Aggrieved Person.\u00a0 Any aggrieved person may request revocation of a permit by application to the Director or City Engineer, whichever has jurisdiction, specifying with particularity the grounds for revocation.\u00a0 The Director or City Engineer shall review the stated grounds for revocation and shall determine whether to initiate revocation proceedings.\u00a0 An appeal from a revocation action may be taken in the same manner prescribed in Subsection H of this section.\n\n\tO.\tExtensions of Time.\n\n\t1.\tApplication.\u00a0 Prior to the expiration of a Coastal Development Permit, an Applicant may apply for a one year extension of the permit.\u00a0 Prior to the expiration of any extension, the Applicant may apply for another one year extension of the permit.\u00a0 An application for an extension of time shall automatically keep the permit in effect until the Approving Authority has acted upon the request.\u00a0 However, if construction has not commenced at the time the application is made, construction may not commence after the initial expiration date until the Approving Authority has acted upon the request.\u00a0 The application shall state the reasons for the request and shall be accompanied by evidence of a valid, unexpired permit and of the Applicant\u2019s continued property interest.\n\n\t2.\tProcedures.\u00a0 The procedures for applying for an extension of time shall be in accordance with Subsections D.,\u00a0 E., and F. of this section. \u00a0\n\n\t3.\tFindings.\u00a0 The Approving Authority shall only grant an extension if the Approving Authority can make the same findings as were required for the original permit, with no new conditions, and must make an additional finding that there are no changed circumstances which would affect the Coastal Development\u2019s consistency with the Local Coastal Program. \u00a0\n\n\t4.\tAppeal.\u00a0 An extension of time for a Coastal Development Permit may be appealed in accordance with Subsection H. of this section.\u00a0 However, in addition to the notice provisions required in that subsection, the Approving Authority shall also notify any persons who objected to the Approving Authority\u2019s approval of an extension.\u00a0\n\n\tP.\tImmaterial Changes to a Coastal Development Permit. \u00a0\n\n\t1.\tApplication.\u00a0 An application for an immaterial change to a Coastal Development Permit shall be filed with the Approving Authority that approved the existing permit.\n\n\t2.\tApproval.\u00a0 If the Approving Authority finds that the proposed change conforms to the original findings and conditions required for the Coastal Development Permit and is in substantial conformance with that Permit, then the Approving Authority may approve the proposed change.\u00a0\n\n\tQ.\tPermit Amendments.\n\n\t1.\tApplication.\u00a0 If the Approving Authority that originally granted the Coastal Development Permit finds that a proposed change is not in substantial conformance with the original Coastal Development Permit, the holder of the Permit may apply for an amendment to the Permit in the same manner as an application for a new Coastal Development Permit.\u00a0 This application shall contain a description of the proposed amendment, the reason for the amendment, together with maps, plans or other material appropriate to the request, and shall be accompanied by evidence of a valid, unexpired permit and of the Applicant\u2019s continued legal ownership or interest in the property.\u00a0\n\n\t2.\tProcedures.\u00a0 The procedures for an amendment shall be the same as would be required of a new application at the same location in accordance with Sections D., E. and F. of this section.\n\n\t3.\tAppeals.\u00a0 Appeals of decisions on amendment applications may be made in the same manner as appeals of decisions on the original Coastal Development Permit in Subsection H. above.\n\n\tR.\tEmergency Permits.\u00a0 An Emergency permit shall only be issued in cases where an Emergency necessitates immediate action that would normally require a Coastal Development Permit, and where the worth of any permanent structures erected does not exceed $25,000.\u00a0\n\n\t1.\tApplications.\u00a0 An application for an Emergency Coastal Development Permit shall be made to the Director or the City Engineer, whichever has jurisdiction, within three days of the Emergency or discovery of the danger.\u00a0 The following information shall be included in the request:\n\n\t(a)\tnature of the Emergency;\n\n\t(b)\tcause of the Emergency, if this can be determined;\n\n\t(c)\tlocation of the Emergency;\u00a0\n\n\t(d)\tthe remedial, protective or preventive work required to deal with the Emergency; and\n\n\t(e)\tthe circumstances during the Emergency that justify the proposed course of action, including the probable consequences of failing to take action.\n\n\t2.\tVerification of Emergency.\u00a0 The Director or City Engineer shall verify the facts, including the existence and the nature of the Emergency, insofar as time\u00a0 permits.\n\n\t3.\tProcedure.\u00a0 The Director or City Engineer shall provide public notice of the Emergency work, with the extent and type of notice determined on the basis of the nature of the Emergency.\u00a0 The Director or City Engineer shall not issue an Emergency permit for any work that falls within the provisions of Public Resources Code Sections 30519(b) and 30601.\u00a0 The Director or City Engineer may grant an Emergency permit upon reasonable terms and conditions, if the Director or City Engineer finds that:\n\n\t(a)\tan Emergency exists that requires action more quickly than the regular permit process would allow, and the work can or will be completed within 30 days, unless otherwise specified by the terms of the permit;\n\n\t(b)\tpublic comment on the proposed Emergency action has been reviewed, if time allows; and\n\n\t(c)\tthe work proposed would be consistent with the certified Local Coastal Program and any adopted, relevant community or specific plans.\n\n\t4.\tCompliance.\u00a0 An Emergency permit shall be valid for not more than 60 days from the date of issuance.\u00a0 Prior to expiration of the Emergency permit, the permittee must submit a Coastal Development Permit application for the Coastal Development or else remove the Coastal Development undertaken pursuant to the Emergency permit in its entirety and restore the site to its previous condition. Failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection or failure by the permittee to properly notice and report any Emergency actions may result in the revocation of the Emergency permit.\n\n\t5.\tReporting.\u00a0 The Director or City Engineer shall notify the Coastal Commission of the issuance of an Emergency permit by phone or letter as soon as possible, but in any event within three days of the issuance of the Emergency permit.","order_by":"20.2.1","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"20","name":"Specific Planning \u2013 Zoning\nComprehensive Zoning
