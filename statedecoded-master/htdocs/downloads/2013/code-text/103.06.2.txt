TEMPORARY PERMITS. (§ 103.06.2)

  TEMPORARY PERMITS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 176,066, Eff. 8/8/04)	The Board may issue a temporary
permit upon the acceptance of a complete application pursuant to Section
103.02.1(d) pending its action on an application.  A temporary permit shall
expire upon the Board’s action on the application or the withdrawal of the
application by the applicant.	The Board may also issue a temporary permit if a
permittee or applicant seeks judicial review pursuant to Section 103.34.2. 
Within ten business days after the Board mails its final decision, the permittee
may file a written application to the Board for a temporary permit pending
judicial review.  Within seven business days of acceptance of the application,
the Board shall render its decision.  If required to do so by law, the Board
shall grant the temporary permit.  This temporary permit shall expire when a
court of competent jurisdiction renders a final decision in the litigation.  In
addition to any other grounds to suspend or revoke a temporary permit, the Board
may revoke a temporary permit if the permittee fails to diligently pursue the
judicial action.	In the event the Board denies an application for a temporary
permit pending judicial review or the permittee rejects the board’s proposed
conditions, the original permit shall expire no sooner than 38 days from the
mailing of the Board’s action.	In issuing any temporary permit, the Board may
impose conditions upon the permit as the Board finds necessary to assure the
preservation of the public health and safety.
