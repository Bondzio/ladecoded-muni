PIPE LINES. (§ 57.95.18)

  PIPE LINES.	Oil pipe lines on petroleum wharfs shall be steel or wrought iron
pipe of a grade suitable for service, shall be reasonably protected against
mechanical injury, and shall be installed, supported, and maintained as
necessary to safely withstand the stresses imposed by internal and external
loads and by contraction, expansion, vibration, or subsidence.	Pipe lines from
the pump to the wharf shall be tested annually for tightness at a pressure not
less than 150 percent of the maximum pumping pressure.  The Terminal Operator
shall certify in writing to the Chief, when and at what pressure the pipe lines
were tested.  All piping installed, renewed, or rearranged between shore and
petroleum wharfs of timber construction shall be provided with approved means to
permit independent movement of the wharf or shore piping without excessive
strain on the pipe.
