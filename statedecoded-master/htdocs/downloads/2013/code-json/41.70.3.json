ascertained or the registered owner fails to redeem the vehicle within 60 days of the seizure.\u00a0 The registered owner of the vehicle may claim the vehicle upon payment of tow, storage and release charges, provided the vehicle is not subject to any holds for traffic or parking violations and the vehicle registration is current.\u00a0\n\n\tI.\tRecovery of Monetary Loss.\u00a0 Nothing in this
