PERMITS NON-TRANSFERABLE. (§ 103.08)

  PERMITS NON-TRANSFERABLE.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 175,676, Eff. 1/11/04.)	A permit issued by the Board may
not be sold, transferred, or assigned by any permittee or by operation of law,
to any other person, group, partnership, corporation, or any other entity.  Any
sale, transfer, or assignment or attempted sale, transfer, or assignment shall
be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of the permit and the permit shall
thereafter be null and void.  A permit held by a corporation or partnership or
other business entity is subject to the same rules of transferability as stated
above.  A new permit shall be required for a transfer of stock that causes a
change in the controlling interest in a corporate permittee, and for a change in
the majority ownership of a partnership or other legal entity, whether by sale,
exchange or other means.
