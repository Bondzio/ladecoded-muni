BUTTRESS FILLS. (§ 91.7015)

  BUTTRESS FILLS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)91.7015.1.  General.  A buttress
fill is a designed compacted earth fill used for providing lateral support to an
unstabilized rock mass.  All buttress fills shall comply with the more
restrictive of the requirements of this section or Section 91.7006.91.7015.2. 
Foundation.  The ability of the foundation material to support the buttress
shall be investigated and the soils engineer shall provide specifications for
keying of the base of the buttress and for bonding the buttress to the natural
ground.91.7015.3.  Base Width.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.) 
The minimum base width of a buttress fill shall not be less than 12 feet (3658
mm) or less than one half its height, whichever is the greater.  The width of a
buttress fill may vary uniformly to a top width of not less than 12 feet (3658
mm).91.7015.4.  Slope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  The
exposed surface of a buttress fill shall not exceed a slope of one unit vertical
in two units horizontal (50% slope).	EXCEPTION:  The Department or the board,
in case an appeal is made to it under Section 91.105, may permit a buttress fill
to be made which creates an exposed surface steeper in slope than one unit
vertical in two units horizontal (50% slope), provided:	1.	The use of the
steeper slope is determined to be necessary due to special design limitations on
the site;	2.	The gradient does not exceed one unit vertical in one and one-half
units horizontal (66.7% slope); and	3.	The applicant shows through
investigation, subsurface exploration, analysis and report by both a soils
engineer and an engineering geologist to the Department’s satisfaction, that
the buttress fill to be used and the underlying earth material supporting the
fill will have strength characteristics sufficient to produce a stable slope
with a minimum factor of safety of not less than 1.5 for static
loads.91.7015.5.  Subdrains.  Subdrains which blanket the entire back face of
the buttress or which occur at intervals shall be provided to prevent buildup of
hydrostatic pressure.  Details of subdrains shall be provided by the soils
engineer and approved by the Department.91.7015.6.  Blanket Seals.  (Amended
by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  Blanket seals of relatively impervious
material shall be required on cut pads above buttress fills where grading
exposes the strata to infiltration of water.  The blanket shall be of 2-foot
(610 mm) minimum thickness or of such greater dimension as specified by the
soils engineer.91.7015.7.  Design.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff.
12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  For design purposes, a maximum value of 75 pound per
square feet (3.6 kN/m2) cohesion and an angle of internal friction of six
degrees may be used to determine the resistance of the bedding plane.  Use of
greater value shall be substantiated by tests taken along the probable slip
plane under conditions simulating the worst possible field conditions.  The
method of performing these tests shall be included in the soils engineer’s
report.	The type, percentage of compaction, cohesion and angle of internal
friction of the materials to be placed in the buttress shall be specified.	The
buttress fill shall be designed for a minimum safety factor of 1.50 based on the
residual strength of the bedrock and the lowest shear strength of the fill
material.

drainage benches shall be formed before pouring concrete.  Forms shall be set
to grade and alignment at all breaks in the cross sections.  The concrete shall
be screeded to cross sections.2.	Gunite drainage benches shall be shot to wire
guides.  Guides shall be set to grade and alignment at all breaks in the cross
section.  The Gunite shall be screeded to cross section.3.	When concrete is to
be places against earth, the area to be covered shall be trimmed and finished to
the dimensions shown on the plans.  The area shall be moistened and thoroughly
compacted to form a firm foundation.  Grade stakes shall be installed to
clearly establish flow lines.FIGURE E
