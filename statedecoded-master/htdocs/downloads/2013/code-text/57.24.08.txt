	(Amended by Ord. No. 170,955, Eff. 4/11/96.)	Fumigation is prohibited, except
within an approved fumigation chamber, inside any room, building, ship, or other
structure, until all persons other than fumigators have been removed therefrom
in compliance with the requirements of the State Division of Industrial Safety,
the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Structural Pest Control Act, and all
animals (other than insects, rats, mice, pocket gophers, ground squirrels and
moles) have been removed therefrom.	EXCEPTION:	Evacuation pursuant to this
section is not necessary (except where hydrogen cyanide is used) in industrial
buildings or miscellaneous structures in which tarpaulin fumigation is being
conducted, provided the volume of material or space under fumigation does not
exceed eight percent of the volume of the building, structure or portion thereof
in which the fumigation is being carried on.	NOTE:	Where approved division walls
are found in a building, each section separated by the division shall constitute
a separate building.
