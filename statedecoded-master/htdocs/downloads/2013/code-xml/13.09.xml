	(New Sec. 13.09 Added by Ord. No. 172,171, Eff. 9/27/98.)

	A.	Purpose.&#xA0; The purpose of the is to implement the General Plan by encouraging land uses that combine Commercial Uses and dwelling units in order to reduce vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled by locating residents, jobs, and services near each other; to improve air quality through a reduction of vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled; to support the transit system; to promote economic vitality and the revitalization of areas of special need; to provide for a variety of housing opportunities, including senior housing; to improve the efficiency of public services, systems, and utilities; to promote design quality and flexibility; and to promote pleasing and interesting urban form and architecture.&#xA0; Areas proximate to mass transit stations and major bus routes are appropriate locations for Mixed Use Districts.

	B.	Establishment of District.

	1.	Requirements.&#xA0; A Mixed Use District may only include lots in the R5, CR, C1, C1.5, C2, C4, or C5 zones.&#xA0; Lots in the R3 or R4 zones may also be included in a Mixed Use District if they (1) abut a designated major or secondary highway; and (2) are also located in a Community Plan designated regional or community center.

	A Mixed Use District shall contain no less than one Block Face.&#xA0; The total acreage in a Mixed Use District shall include contiguous parcels of land which may only be separated by public streets, alleys, or other physical features, or as determined by the Director of Planning, or his/her designee.&#xA0; Precise boundaries are required to be delineated at the time of application or initiation of an individual rezoning application to Mixed Use District.

	A Mixed Use District shall be consistent with the intent and purposes of the applicable Community Plan.&#xA0; If, as determined by the Director of Planning or his/her designee, the provisions of this section conflict with those of an adopted specific plan, then the provisions of the specific plan shall prevail.&#xA0; If the provisions of this section conflict with any other citywide regulations except an adopted specific plan, then the provisions of this section shall prevail.&#xA0; If &#x201C;Q&#x201D; or &#x201C;D&#x201D; limitations have been imposed on a lot, then the most restrictive requirement shall prevail.

	2.	Standard Provisions and Permitted Modifications.&#xA0; In establishing an individual Mixed Use District, all of the standard provisions set forth in Subsection C, Uses; Subsection D, Yards; Subsection E, Development Incentives; Subsection F, Development Standards; and Subsection G, Pedestrian Orientation, shall apply.

	However, based on an appropriate consideration of the proposed district&#x2019;s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, objectives, and policies set forth in the applicable Community Plan, some of the standard provisions set forth in Subsections C or E may be eliminated or modified, as further described below.

	3.	Definitions.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, the following definitions shall apply to this section:

	E.	Development Incentives.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the following development incentives shall apply in Mixed Use Districts:

	1.	Housing.&#xA0; The individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District shall establish an incentive for dwelling units in Mixed Use Projects.&#xA0; The amount of the incentive shall be based on an appropriate consideration of the proposed district&#x2019;s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan.

	The incentive shall be shown on the &#x201C;Zoning Map&#x201D; by use of the capital letters &#x201C;MU&#x201D; for Mixed Use Projects and &#x201C;C&#x201D; for Commercial Uses, preceded by the applicable numerical limits.&#xA0; The first two-digit number before the diagonal line shall indicate the maximum height permitted.&#xA0; The first number after the diagonal line, which may include a decimal fraction, shall indicate the maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR).&#xA0; For example, a Mixed Use District zoned C2 45/2.0-MU 35/1.5-C means that a Mixed Use Project may not exceed a maximum height of 45 feet for the entire Project or an FAR of 2.0.&#xA0; The Commercial Uses in a Mixed Use Project would be restricted to a maximum FAR of 1.5.&#xA0; Projects comprised exclusively of Commercial Uses would be restricted to a maximum height of 35 feet and a maximum FAR of 1.5.&#xA0; If the letter &#x201C;U&#x201D; appears before the diagonal line instead of a number, then an unlimited height is permitted.

	(a)	If a height or FAR housing incentive would result in a maximum height or FAR which exceeds that of the underlying base zone, then the Project may not proceed until the height district of the base zone is changed.

	(b)	The minimum dwelling unit FAR for Mixed Use Projects with a total FAR of 6.0 or greater is 1.5

	(c)	The lot area requirements of the R5 zone shall apply to Mixed Use Projects with a total FAR of 6.0 or greater.

	2.	Pedestrian Amenities.&#xA0; Pedestrian Amenities shall not be included in the calculation of permitted FAR.

	3.	Parking.&#xA0; If a proposed Mixed Use District includes lots within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major Bus Center, or lots within 750 feet of a Central Parking Structure, then the individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District shall include a parking incentive which specifies a reduction in the number of parking spaces required by Section 12.21A4.&#xA0; Provided, however, a minimum of two spaces for every 1,000 square feet of non-residential floor area shall be required.&#xA0; In determining the appropriate level of parking reduction, the City Council shall consider such factors as local transit dependency and automobile usage, traffic, available parking, and level of transit service, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan.

	(a)	Transit Facilities.&#xA0; The transit facility incentive shall be restricted to dwelling units and Commercial Uses in Mixed Use Projects within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major Bus Center.

	(b)	Central Parking Structures.&#xA0; The Central Parking Structure incentive shall be restricted to Commercial Uses within 750 feet of a Central Parking Structure.&#xA0; To make use of this incentive, the owner(s) of the Central Parking Structure must execute and record in the Los Angeles County Recorder&#x2019;s Office, a covenant and agreement for the benefit of the City of Los Angeles which provides that the required parking shall be maintained in perpetuity or until the Director of Planning determines that it is no longer necessary.&#xA0; This incentive may not be combined with the transit facility incentive set forth in (a) above.

	(c)	Measurement of Distance.&#xA0; Distance from a transit facility or Central Parking Structure shall be measured as specified in Section 12.21A4(g).

	(d)	Downtown Exceptions.&#xA0; The parking incentive for dwelling units as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) above shall not be authorized in the Parking Exception Area for the Central City as described in Section 12.21A4(p).&#xA0; The parking incentive for Commercial Uses as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) and (b) above shall not be authorized in the Downtown Business District Exception Area as described in Section 12.21A4(I).

	(e)	Affordable Housing.&#xA0; The transit facility and Central Parking Structure incentives set forth above shall not be combined with the parking reduction provided for affordable housing as set forth in Section 12.22A25(d)(2).

	4.	Facade Treatments, Corner Lots, and Community Facilities.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; Each Mixed Use Project shall be entitled to one of the following incentives by right.&#xA0; To obtain an entitlement for two or more of these incentives, the approval of the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 12.24W28 is required.

	(a)	Facade Treatments.&#xA0; Unless eliminated or modified by the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District, if the maximum height otherwise permitted by the underlying zone or established pursuant to Section 13.09E1 above is less than 100 feet, then a Mixed Use Project is entitled to an increase in height of no more than ten feet, provided that the additional height is used for a Facade Treatment.

	The individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District may not modify the following restrictions:

	(1)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be utilized on lots adjacent to or abutting an RW1 or more restrictive zone as defined by Sections 12.04 or 12.23;

	(2)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be combined with the Corner Lot incentive described in Paragraph (b) below; and

	(3)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be used for signs or to increase the floor area of a structure.

	(b)	Corner Lots.&#xA0; Unless eliminated or modified by the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District, a Mixed Use Project on a Corner Lot is entitled to an increase in height, FAR, and residential density for dwelling units that is 20 percent greater than what is otherwise permitted by the underlying zone or what is established pursuant to Section 13.09E1 above.

	The individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District may not modify the following restrictions:
	(1)	Unless a conditional use permit pursuant to Section 12.24 W 28 is also obtained, a Mixed Use Project which secures an affordable housing density bonus pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915 shall not also be entitled to the Corner Lot incentive; and

	(2)	The Corner Lot incentive may not be utilized on lots adjacent to or abutting an RW1 Zone or a more restrictive zone as defined by Sections 12.04 or 12.23.

	(c)	Community Facilities.&#xA0; Unless modified by the individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District, no more than 75 percent of the total floor area of a child or adult day care facility, community meeting room, cultural center, museum or telecommuting center shall be included in the calculation of permitted FAR.

	5.	Mini-Shopping Centers and Commercial Corner Developments.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 172,350, Eff. 1/30/99.)&#xA0; Mixed Use Projects are exempt from the regulations governing Mini-Shopping Centers and Commercial Corner Developments as set forth in Section 12.22A23.

other; to improve air quality through a reduction of vehicle trips and vehicle
miles traveled; to support the transit system; to promote economic vitality and
the revitalization of areas of special need; to provide for a variety of housing
opportunities, including senior housing; to improve the efficiency of public
services, systems, and utilities; to promote design quality and flexibility; and
to promote pleasing and interesting urban form and architecture.&#xA0; Areas
proximate to mass transit stations and major bus routes are appropriate
locations for Mixed Use Districts.	B.	Establishment of
District.	1.	Requirements.&#xA0; A Mixed Use District may only include lots in the
R5, CR, C1, C1.5, C2, C4, or C5 zones.&#xA0; Lots in the R3 or R4 zones may also be
included in a Mixed Use District if they (1) abut a designated major or
secondary highway; and (2) are also located in a Community Plan designated
regional or community center.	A Mixed Use District shall contain no less than
one Block Face.&#xA0; The total acreage in a Mixed Use District shall include
contiguous parcels of land which may only be separated by public streets,
alleys, or other physical features, or as determined by the Director of
Planning, or his/her designee.&#xA0; Precise boundaries are required to be
delineated at the time of application or initiation of an individual rezoning
application to Mixed Use District.	A Mixed Use District shall be consistent with
the intent and purposes of the applicable Community Plan.&#xA0; If, as determined by
the Director of Planning or his/her designee, the provisions of this section
conflict with those of an adopted specific plan, then the provisions of the
specific plan shall prevail.&#xA0; If the provisions of this section conflict with
any other citywide regulations except an adopted specific plan, then the
provisions of this section shall prevail.&#xA0; If &#x201C;Q&#x201D; or &#x201C;D&#x201D; limitations
have been imposed on a lot, then the most restrictive requirement shall
prevail.	2.	Standard Provisions and Permitted Modifications.&#xA0; In establishing
an individual Mixed Use District, all of the standard provisions set forth in
Subsection C, Uses; Subsection D, Yards; Subsection E, Development Incentives;
Subsection F, Development Standards; and Subsection G, Pedestrian Orientation,
shall apply.	However, based on an appropriate consideration of the proposed
district&#x2019;s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals,
objectives, and policies set forth in the applicable Community Plan, some of the
standard provisions set forth in Subsections C or E may be eliminated or

ordinance establishing a Mixed use District may amend this provision and permit
Projects comprised exclusively of dwelling units in all or parts of the
District.	4.	If the City Council finds that further restricting the uses in a
Mixed Use District is appropriate in light of the proposed district&#x2019;s
character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, policies, and
objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan, then the Council may do
so in the ordinance establishing the district.	D.	Yards.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any

Incentives.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the
contrary, the following development incentives shall apply in Mixed Use
Districts:	1.	Housing.&#xA0; The individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use
District shall establish an incentive for dwelling units in Mixed Use
Projects.&#xA0; The amount of the incentive shall be based on an appropriate
consideration of the proposed district&#x2019;s character, needs, and development
potential, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable
Community Plan.	The incentive shall be shown on the &#x201C;Zoning Map&#x201D; by use of
the capital letters &#x201C;MU&#x201D; for Mixed Use Projects and &#x201C;C&#x201D; for Commercial
Uses, preceded by the applicable numerical limits.&#xA0; The first two-digit number
before the diagonal line shall indicate the maximum height permitted.&#xA0; The
first number after the diagonal line, which may include a decimal fraction,
shall indicate the maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR).&#xA0; For example, a
Mixed Use District zoned C2 45/2.0-MU 35/1.5-C means that a Mixed Use Project
may not exceed a maximum height of 45 feet for the entire Project or an FAR of
2.0.&#xA0; The Commercial Uses in a Mixed Use Project would be restricted to a
maximum FAR of 1.5.&#xA0; Projects comprised exclusively of Commercial Uses would be
restricted to a maximum height of 35 feet and a maximum FAR of 1.5.&#xA0; If the
letter &#x201C;U&#x201D; appears before the diagonal line instead of a number, then an
unlimited height is permitted.	(a)	If a height or FAR housing incentive would
result in a maximum height or FAR which exceeds that of the underlying base
zone, then the Project may not proceed until the height district of the base
zone is changed.	(b)	The minimum dwelling unit FAR for Mixed Use Projects with a
total FAR of 6.0 or greater is 1.5	(c)	The lot area requirements of the R5 zone
shall apply to Mixed Use Projects with a total FAR of 6.0 or
greater.	2.	Pedestrian Amenities.&#xA0; Pedestrian Amenities shall not be included
in the calculation of permitted FAR.	3.	Parking.&#xA0; If a proposed Mixed Use
District includes lots within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major Bus
Center, or lots within 750 feet of a Central Parking Structure, then the
individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District shall include a parking
incentive which specifies a reduction in the number of parking spaces required
by Section 12.21A4.&#xA0; Provided, however, a minimum of two spaces for every 1,000
square feet of non-residential floor area shall be required.&#xA0; In determining
the appropriate level of parking reduction, the City Council shall consider such
factors as local transit dependency and automobile usage, traffic, available
parking, and level of transit service, and the goals, policies, and objectives
set forth in the applicable Community Plan.	(a)	Transit Facilities.&#xA0; The
transit facility incentive shall be restricted to dwelling units and Commercial
Uses in Mixed Use Projects within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major
Bus Center.	(b)	Central Parking Structures.&#xA0; The Central Parking Structure
incentive shall be restricted to Commercial Uses within 750 feet of a Central
Parking Structure.&#xA0; To make use of this incentive, the owner(s) of the Central
Parking Structure must execute and record in the Los Angeles County Recorder&#x2019;s
Office, a covenant and agreement for the benefit of the City of Los Angeles
which provides that the required parking shall be maintained in perpetuity or
until the Director of Planning determines that it is no longer necessary.&#xA0; This
incentive may not be combined with the transit facility incentive set forth in
(a) above.	(c)	Measurement of Distance.&#xA0; Distance from a transit facility or
Central Parking Structure shall be measured as specified in Section
12.21A4(g).	(d)	Downtown Exceptions.&#xA0; The parking incentive for dwelling units
as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) above shall not be authorized in the Parking
Exception Area for the Central City as described in Section 12.21A4(p).&#xA0; The
parking incentive for Commercial Uses as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) and (b)
above shall not be authorized in the Downtown Business District Exception Area
as described in Section 12.21A4(I).	(e)	Affordable Housing.&#xA0; The transit
facility and Central Parking Structure incentives set forth above shall not be
combined with the parking reduction provided for affordable housing as set forth
in Section 12.22A25(d)(2).	4.	Facade Treatments, Corner Lots, and Community
Facilities.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; Each Mixed Use
Project shall be entitled to one of the following incentives by right.&#xA0; To
obtain an entitlement for two or more of these incentives, the approval of the
Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 12.24W28 is required.	(a)	Facade
Treatments.&#xA0; Unless eliminated or modified by the individual ordinance
establishing a Mixed Use District, if the maximum height otherwise permitted by
the underlying zone or established pursuant to Section 13.09E1 above is less
than 100 feet, then a Mixed Use Project is entitled to an increase in height of
no more than ten feet, provided that the additional height is used for a Facade
Treatment.	The individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District may not
modify the following restrictions:	(1)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be
utilized on lots adjacent to or abutting an RW1 or more restrictive zone as
defined by Sections 12.04 or 12.23;	(2)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not
be combined with the Corner Lot incentive described in Paragraph (b) below;
and	(3)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be used for signs or to increase
the floor area of a structure.	(b)	Corner Lots.&#xA0; Unless eliminated or modified
by the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District, a Mixed Use
Project on a Corner Lot is entitled to an increase in height, FAR, and
residential density for dwelling units that is 20 percent greater than what is
otherwise permitted by the underlying zone or what is established pursuant to
Section 13.09E1 above.	The individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use
District may not modify the following restrictions:
	(1)	Unless a conditional use permit pursuant to Section 12.24 W 28 is also
obtained, a Mixed Use Project which secures an affordable housing density bonus
pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915 shall not also be entitled
to the Corner Lot incentive; and	(2)	The Corner Lot incentive may not be
utilized on lots adjacent to or abutting an RW1 Zone or a more restrictive zone
as defined by Sections 12.04 or 12.23.	(c)	Community Facilities.&#xA0; Unless
modified by the individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District, no
more than 75 percent of the total floor area of a child or adult day care
facility, community meeting room, cultural center, museum or telecommuting
center shall be included in the calculation of permitted FAR.	5.	Mini-Shopping
Centers and Commercial Corner Developments.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 172,350, Eff.
1/30/99.)&#xA0; Mixed Use Projects are exempt from the regulations governing

	(New Sec. 13.09 Added by Ord. No. 172,171, Eff. 9/27/98.)	A.	Purpose.&#xA0; The purpose of the is to implement the General Plan by encouraging land uses that combine Commercial Uses and dwelling units in order to reduce vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled by locating residents, jobs, and services near each other; to improve air quality through a reduction of vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled; to support the transit system; to promote economic vitality and the revitalization of areas of special need; to provide for a variety of housing opportunities, including senior housing; to improve the efficiency of public services, systems, and utilities; to promote design quality and flexibility; and to promote pleasing and interesting urban form and architecture.&#xA0; Areas proximate to mass transit stations and major bus routes are appropriate locations for Mixed Use Districts.	B.	Establishment of District.	1.	Requirements.&#xA0; A Mixed Use District may only include lots in the R5, CR, C1, C1.5, C2, C4, or C5 zones.&#xA0; Lots in the R3 or R4 zones may also be included in a Mixed Use District if they (1) abut a designated major or secondary highway; and (2) are also located in a Community Plan designated regional or community center.	A Mixed Use District shall contain no less than one Block Face.&#xA0; The total acreage in a Mixed Use District shall include contiguous parcels of land which may only be separated by public streets, alleys, or other physical features, or as determined by the Director of Planning, or his/her designee.&#xA0; Precise boundaries are required to be delineated at the time of application or initiation of an individual rezoning application to Mixed Use District.	A Mixed Use District shall be consistent with the intent and purposes of the applicable Community Plan.&#xA0; If, as determined by the Director of Planning or his/her designee, the provisions of this section conflict with those of an adopted specific plan, then the provisions of the specific plan shall prevail.&#xA0; If the provisions of this section conflict with any other citywide regulations except an adopted specific plan, then the provisions of this section shall prevail.&#xA0; If &#x201C;Q&#x201D; or &#x201C;D&#x201D; limitations have been imposed on a lot, then the most restrictive requirement shall prevail.	2.	Standard Provisions and Permitted Modifications.&#xA0; In establishing an individual Mixed Use District, all of the standard provisions set forth in Subsection C, Uses; Subsection D, Yards; Subsection E, Development Incentives; Subsection F, Development Standards; and Subsection G, Pedestrian Orientation, shall apply.	However, based on an appropriate consideration of the proposed district&#x2019;s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, objectives, and policies set forth in the applicable Community Plan, some of the standard provisions set forth in Subsections C or E may be eliminated or modified, as further described below.	3.	Definitions.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, the following definitions shall apply to this section:	Automotive Uses means automobile and trailer sales areas, automobile dismantling yards, automotive fueling and service stations, and automotive repair uses as defined in Section 12.03.

Projects comprised exclusively of dwelling units are not permitted on lots in the CR, C1, C1.5, C2, C4, or C5 zone, except with the approval of the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 12.27I23.&#xA0; However, the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed use District may amend this provision and permit Projects comprised exclusively of dwelling units in all or parts of the District.	4.	If the City Council finds that further restricting the uses in a Mixed Use District is appropriate in light of the proposed district&#x2019;s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan, then the Council may do so in the ordinance establishing the district.	D.	Yards.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article to the contrary, the following yards shall apply to Mixed Use Projects:	1.

Development Incentives.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the following development incentives shall apply in Mixed Use Districts:	1.	Housing.&#xA0; The individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District shall establish an incentive for dwelling units in Mixed Use Projects.&#xA0; The amount of the incentive shall be based on an appropriate consideration of the proposed district&#x2019;s character, needs, and development potential, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan.	The incentive shall be shown on the &#x201C;Zoning Map&#x201D; by use of the capital letters &#x201C;MU&#x201D; for Mixed Use Projects and &#x201C;C&#x201D; for Commercial Uses, preceded by the applicable numerical limits.&#xA0; The first two-digit number before the diagonal line shall indicate the maximum height permitted.&#xA0; The first number after the diagonal line, which may include a decimal fraction, shall indicate the maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR).&#xA0; For example, a Mixed Use District zoned C2 45/2.0-MU 35/1.5-C means that a Mixed Use Project may not exceed a maximum height of 45 feet for the entire Project or an FAR of 2.0.&#xA0; The Commercial Uses in a Mixed Use Project would be restricted to a maximum FAR of 1.5.&#xA0; Projects comprised exclusively of Commercial Uses would be restricted to a maximum height of 35 feet and a maximum FAR of 1.5.&#xA0; If the letter &#x201C;U&#x201D; appears before the diagonal line instead of a number, then an unlimited height is permitted.	(a)	If a height or FAR housing incentive would result in a maximum height or FAR which exceeds that of the underlying base zone, then the Project may not proceed until the height district of the base zone is changed.	(b)	The minimum dwelling unit FAR for Mixed Use Projects with a total FAR of 6.0 or greater is 1.5	(c)	The lot area requirements of the R5 zone shall apply to Mixed Use Projects with a total FAR of 6.0 or greater.	2.	Pedestrian Amenities.&#xA0; Pedestrian Amenities shall not be included in the calculation of permitted FAR.	3.	Parking.&#xA0; If a proposed Mixed Use District includes lots within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major Bus Center, or lots within 750 feet of a Central Parking Structure, then the individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District shall include a parking incentive which specifies a reduction in the number of parking spaces required by Section 12.21A4.&#xA0; Provided, however, a minimum of two spaces for every 1,000 square feet of non-residential floor area shall be required.&#xA0; In determining the appropriate level of parking reduction, the City Council shall consider such factors as local transit dependency and automobile usage, traffic, available parking, and level of transit service, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable Community Plan.	(a)	Transit Facilities.&#xA0; The transit facility incentive shall be restricted to dwelling units and Commercial Uses in Mixed Use Projects within 1,500 feet of a Mass Transit Station or Major Bus Center.	(b)	Central Parking Structures.&#xA0; The Central Parking Structure incentive shall be restricted to Commercial Uses within 750 feet of a Central Parking Structure.&#xA0; To make use of this incentive, the owner(s) of the Central Parking Structure must execute and record in the Los Angeles County Recorder&#x2019;s Office, a covenant and agreement for the benefit of the City of Los Angeles which provides that the required parking shall be maintained in perpetuity or until the Director of Planning determines that it is no longer necessary.&#xA0; This incentive may not be combined with the transit facility incentive set forth in (a) above.	(c)	Measurement of Distance.&#xA0; Distance from a transit facility or Central Parking Structure shall be measured as specified in Section 12.21A4(g).	(d)	Downtown Exceptions.&#xA0; The parking incentive for dwelling units as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) above shall not be authorized in the Parking Exception Area for the Central City as described in Section 12.21A4(p).&#xA0; The parking incentive for Commercial Uses as set forth in Section 13.09E3(a) and (b) above shall not be authorized in the Downtown Business District Exception Area as described in Section 12.21A4(I).	(e)	Affordable Housing.&#xA0; The transit facility and Central Parking Structure incentives set forth above shall not be combined with the parking reduction provided for affordable housing as set forth in Section 12.22A25(d)(2).	4.	Facade Treatments, Corner Lots, and Community Facilities.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; Each Mixed Use Project shall be entitled to one of the following incentives by right.&#xA0; To obtain an entitlement for two or more of these incentives, the approval of the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 12.24W28 is required.	(a)	Facade Treatments.&#xA0; Unless eliminated or modified by the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District, if the maximum height otherwise permitted by the underlying zone or established pursuant to Section 13.09E1 above is less than 100 feet, then a Mixed Use Project is entitled to an increase in height of no more than ten feet, provided that the additional height is used for a Facade Treatment.	The individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District may not modify the following restrictions:	(1)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be utilized on lots adjacent to or abutting an RW1 or more restrictive zone as defined by Sections 12.04 or 12.23;	(2)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be combined with the Corner Lot incentive described in Paragraph (b) below; and	(3)	The Facade Treatment incentive may not be used for signs or to increase the floor area of a structure.	(b)	Corner Lots.&#xA0; Unless eliminated or modified by the individual ordinance establishing a Mixed Use District, a Mixed Use Project on a Corner Lot is entitled to an increase in height, FAR, and residential density for dwelling units that is 20 percent greater than what is otherwise permitted by the underlying zone or what is established pursuant to Section 13.09E1 above.	The individual ordinance establishing the Mixed Use District may not modify the following restrictions:
