                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

TORT CLAIMS – SOLICITING. (§ 43.28)

  TORT CLAIMS – SOLICITING.	No person shall solicit employment for himself or
for any other person acting on his behalf to prosecute, collect, settle,
compromise or to negotiate for the settlement, compromise or collection of any
tort claim, on behalf of any tort claimant, in which he himself has no pecuniary
interest arising from such tort.	The provisions of this section shall not be
construed to prevent joint tort claimants from negotiating with each other for
the purpose of combining respective claims or actions against the tort
feasor.	The mere fact that the business of adjusting and settling tort claims
affects the public welfare generally throughout the state does not mean that the
police power to regulate such business, and particularly to prohibit the
solicitation thereof within a given municipality, must be exercised exclusively
by the state legislature but on the contrary, subject only to control of general
laws, the entire police power of the state may be exercised by the council of a
city within the limits of its jurisdiction, and a city ordinance prohibiting
such solicitation is not violative of the federal constitution.
