excavation being made by a department of this City, such notification shall be made by the responsible supervisor.\n\n\t(c)\tProsecution of Work.\u00a0 Unless otherwise provided in special conditions on the permit governing the dates and hours during which work is to done, the work of making and refilling an excavation shall be prosecuted diligently and continuously until completion so as not to obstruct traffic on any roadway or sidewalk longer than is actually necessary.\n\n\tIf the responsible party shall fail, refuse, or neglect to promptly refill any excavation or to promptly perform any other necessary work, the Board may perform such work, and in cases where funds are on deposit with the City in connection with the permit under which the excavation or work is being performed, the cost of the work performed by the Board may be deducted from such deposit.\n\n\t(d)\tPermits to Be Kept on Job Site.\u00a0 Except for work being done prior to the issuance of a permit as authorized by

and\u00a0 structures.\u00a0 The approval of any plans submitted or the issuance of a permit does not relieve\u00a0 the permittee from full responsibility for any damage or injury caused by his operations.\u00a0 Neither the City nor any of its officers or employees shall be liable or responsible for any such damage or injuries.\n\n\t(f)\tSafety.\u00a0 All work in any public street, public place, or public easement shall be performed in strict accordance with the safety provisions of Title 8 of the State of California Administrative Code.\u00a0 Failure by a permittee to adhere to such

sidewalk portion of any street, a crossing for pedestrians shall be provided and maintained.\n\n\tAdditional traffic provisions, particularly in important traffic arteries, may be specified by the City Engineer.\u00a0 Provisions so specified will become a condition of the permit and be binding upon the permittee.\n\n\t(j)\tTraffic Control in Work Areas.\u00a0 Warning signs, barriers, barricades, guidance devices and lights, shall be furnished, placed, and maintained in conformance with the current manual entitled \u201cWork Area Traffic Control Handbook (WATCH)\u201d approved by the Board.\n\n\tIf the warning signs, lights, and devices required under this section are not promptly provided, the Board may provide them; the cost of such work performed by the Board may be recovered in the manner provided in Section 62.05(a) of this Code.\n\n\t(k)\tSite Maintenance.\n\n\t(1)\tAccess to Hydrants and Water Valves.\u00a0 Free access must be provided at all times to all fire hydrants and water valves.\n\n\t(2)\tConfinement of Excavated Material.\u00a0 When excavated material is placed adjacent to the excavation, it shall be placed in such a manner as to economize space and minimize interference with traffic.\u00a0 If necessary, such material shall be confined by suitable bulkheads or other devices.\u00a0 If the street is not of sufficient width to hold excavated material without using part of an adjacent walkway, a passageway at least one-half the width of such walkway shall be kept open at all times.\n\n\t(3)\tMaintenance of Gutters.\u00a0 All gutters shall be maintained free and unobstructed for the full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of such curb at the gutter line.\u00a0 Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting street, an adequate waterway shall be provided and maintained.\n\n\t(l)\tBackfilling.\u00a0 Unless a specific backfill material is required on the permit, backfill material, installation and compaction shall be in accordance with the latest standards and specifications established by the Board or the City Engineer.\n\n\t(m)\tResurfacing.\n\n\t(1)\tTemporary Resurfacing.\u00a0 Except as otherwise provided herein, after completion of backfilling operations, the portion of the paved surface of any public street or public place excavated or damaged shall be immediately resurfaced with temporary resurfacing material by the permittee.\u00a0 Temporary resurfacing shall consist of premixed bituminous material conforming to the specifications for material to be used for such purpose contained in the current Standard Specifications of the Department of Public Works.\u00a0 Such resurfacing after compaction shall be not less than one inch thick in sidewalk areas and not less than two inches thick in driveway and roadway areas.\u00a0 Its surface after compaction shall conform to the finished surface of the roadway or sidewalk.\u00a0 The material shall be compacted so that it is dense and smooth enough to be safe for either pedestrians or vehicular traffic as the case may be, at the maximum speed permitted by law.\n\n\t(2)\tMaintenance of Temporary Resurfacing.\u00a0 The permittee shall maintain the surfacing so that it is safe for pedestrian or vehicular traffic until the excavation is permanently resurfaced.\n\n\tIf it is impracticable to maintain the surface of the backfill in a safe condition for pedestrian travel or vehicular traffic, the permittee shall maintain barriers and lights around it until the excavation has been resurfaced.\n\n\t(3)\tPermanent Resurfacing by City.\u00a0 Unless otherwise authorized herein or specifically authorized by the Board and indicated by the permit, the improved surface of a street excavated or damaged in connection with work being performed by authority of a permit issued under the provisions of Section 62.02 will be permanently surfaced by the permittee.\u00a0 The permittee shall mark each such resurfacing in the manner prescribed by the City Engineer and shall be responsible for the integrity of such resurfacing for a period of five years from installation.\n\n\t(4)\tPermanent Resurfacing by Permittee.\u00a0 In cases where permanent resurfacing by permittee is required, the permanent resurfacing may be placed immediately in lieu of placing and maintaining temporary resurfacing.\n\n\tThe Board may require the area to be permanently resurfaced immediately after completion of the backfilling where such is practical and in the interest of the public safety and welfare.\u00a0 Such requirement shall be specified on the permit.\n\n\tA utility issued a permit for the drilling of leakage detection holes shall make immediate repair to said holes with its own crews, at its own expense, and in the manner prescribed by the Board.\n\n\tWhen an excavation is made to install, remove, or abandon a pole or a structure which forms a portion of the finished surface of a sidewalk or concrete driveway, in lieu of the placement of temporary resurfacing, the person or department of the City making the excavation may permanently restore the surface of the sidewalk or driveway to the nearest scoring line of the square or squares of which the pole does or did occupy or the structure forms or did form a portion of the finished surface.\u00a0 All such restoration shall be made by removing and replacing the entire portion of the walk or driveway between the nearest scoring lines.\u00a0 The surface of an alley may be similarly restored when the purpose of the excavation therein is the installation, relocation or removal of a pole or pole anchor.\u00a0 Construction of the walk, driveway or alley surface shall be done in accordance with the current Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction.\n\n\t(5)\tPermit Required for Resurfacing by Permittee.\u00a0 Except as provided herein, all permanent resurfacing done by permittee in connection with a permit issued under the provisions of Section 62.02, shall be done under a Class \u201cA\u201d permit secured in compliance with Section 62.105 of this Code.\u00a0 All permits obtained for street excavations and subsequent resurfacing activities shall not be in lieu of but in addition to all permits required pursuant to Sections 62.02, 62.04, 64.17 and the Street Damage Restoration Fee Ordinance contained in the L.A.M.C.","order_by":"04","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"36","name":"Streets And
