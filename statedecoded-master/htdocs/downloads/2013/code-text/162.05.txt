RENT REDUCTION SCHEDULE. (§ 162.05)

  RENT REDUCTION SCHEDULE.
	(Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)	The RAC shall adopt by regulation a
schedule setting forth the amount by which the rent shall be reduced, taking
into account the nature of the violation, the severity of the conditions, and
the history of past untenantable conditions.  The RAC may set a maximum rent
reduction if necessary to prevent abandonment of the property or exacerbation of
health and safety violations.  Pending adoption of the schedule, the Department
shall use the schedule adopted pursuant to former Section 151.06.5.
