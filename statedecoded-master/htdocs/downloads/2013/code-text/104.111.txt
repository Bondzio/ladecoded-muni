ONE-YEAR WAIVER FOR CERTAIN HOTEL EMPLOYERS. (§ 104.111)

  ONE-YEAR WAIVER FOR CERTAIN HOTEL EMPLOYERS.	This article is not intended to
cause reduction in employment or work hours for Hotel Workers.  Therefore, a
Hotel Employer that demonstrates to the Controller, by compelling evidence, that
compliance with this article would require the Hotel Employer to reduce its
workforce by more than 20 percent or curtail its Hotel Workers’ total work
hours by more than 30 percent, in order to avoid bankruptcy or a shutdown of the
Hotel, may receive a waiver, valid for no more than one year, from the
requirements in this article.  The Controller shall reach a determination only
after reviewing and auditing, if necessary, the Hotel Employer’s financial
condition, with such review or audit paid for, at rates set by the Controller,
by the Hotel Employer.  The Controller’s determination on a waiver
application shall be subject to review and reversal by a two-thirds vote of the
City Council within 10 business days of the Controller’s determination.
