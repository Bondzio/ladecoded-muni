Side Yard may be reduced to 10% of the width of the Lot, but in no event less than 3 feet.\n\n\t(ii)\tIn lieu of the additional Side Yard requirement in Table 12.21 C.10-1, for a Building more than two-stories in height on Lots in the R1, RS, or RE Zone, one foot shall be added to the width of each required Side Yard for each additional Story above the second Story.\n\n\t(iii)\tOn a Lot in the RA Zone, where a Side Yard is less than 10 feet in width, and the Building erected on the Lot is three or more Stories in height, one foot shall be added to such Side Yard.\n\n\t(9)\tSide Yards in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in Subdivision Approvals.\u00a0 Side Yard requirements in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in subdivision approvals shall take precedence over requirements of this Subdivision 10.\u00a0 Otherwise, this Subdivision shall apply.\n\n\t(10)\tEncroachments Into Required Yards.\u00a0 Every required Front, Side and Rear Yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for the following:\n\n\t(i)\tGarages in Front Yards.\u00a0 A Private Garage may be located on the required Front Yard of a Lot where the Elevation of the ground at a point 50 feet from the front Lot line of a Lot and midway between the side Lot lines differs 10 feet or more from the curb level, provided every portion of the garage Building is at least 5 feet from the front Lot line.\u00a0 Where the wall of such garage is two-thirds below natural or finished Grade of the Lot, whichever is lower, said wall may extend to the adjacent side Lot line; in all other cases, said garage shall not be nearer to the side Lot line than the width of the Side Yard required for a main Building of the same height.\n\n\t(ii)\tOpen, Unenclosed Stairways, Porches, Platforms, Landing Places, or Balconies.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, on Lots fronting onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, open unenclosed stairways, porches, platforms and landing places not covered by a roof or canopy shall not project or extend into the Front Yard.\u00a0 Balconies with 10 feet or more of vertical clearance beneath them may project or extend no more than 30 inches into a Front Yard.\n\n\t(iii)\tOther Exceptions.\u00a0 All of those exceptions found in Subdivision 5. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 and in Section 12.22 of this Code.\n\n\t(11)\tPools, Ponds, or Body of Water in Required Yards.\u00a0 No swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water which is designed or used to contain water 18

50\nfeet from the front Lot line of a Lot and midway between the side Lot lines\ndiffers 10 feet or more from the curb level, provided every portion of the\ngarage Building is at least 5 feet from the front Lot line.\u00a0 Where the wall of\nsuch garage is two-thirds below natural or finished Grade of the Lot, whichever\nis lower, said wall may extend to the adjacent side Lot line; in all other\ncases, said garage shall not be nearer to the side Lot line than the width of\nthe Side Yard required for a main Building of the same height.\t(ii)\tOpen,\nUnenclosed Stairways, Porches, Platforms, Landing Places, or Balconies.\u00a0\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, on Lots fronting onto a\nSubstandard Hillside Limited Street, open unenclosed stairways, porches,\nplatforms and landing places not covered by a roof or canopy shall not project\nor extend into the Front Yard.\u00a0 Balconies with 10 feet or more of vertical\nclearance beneath them may project or extend no more than 30 inches into a Front\nYard.\t(iii)\tOther Exceptions.\u00a0 All of those exceptions found in Subdivision 5.\nof Subsection C. of Section 12.21 and in Section 12.22 of

comprise 40% or more of the Frontage, then the minimum Front Yard depth shall be the average depth of the Front Yards of such Lots.\t(ii)\tWhere there are two or more possible combinations of developed Lots comprising 40% or more of the Frontage, and these Lots have Front Yards that vary in depth by not more than 10 feet, then the minimum Front Yard depth shall be the average depth of the Front Yards of that combination which has the shallowest average depth.\t(iii)\tIn determining the required Front Yard, the following shall not be taken into account:\u00a0 Buildings located on key Lots, entirely on the rear half of Lots, or on Lots in the \u201cC\u201d or \u201cM\u201d Zones.\t(iv)\tNothing contained in this subparagraph (1) shall, however, be deemed to require Front Yards

the Reversed Corner Lot, beyond which point the Front Yard specified in Table 12.21 C.10-1 or Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (a) shall apply.\u00a0 Where existing Buildings on either or both of said adjoining Lots are located nearer to the front or side Lot lines than the Yard required by this Paragraph (a), the Yards established by such existing buildings may be used in computing the required Front Yard for a Key Lot.\t(4)\tFront Yard Setbacks on Through Lots.\u00a0 At each end of a Through Lot, there shall be a Front Yard setback as required by this Paragraph (a) for the zone in which each Street Frontage is located.\u00a0 But only one Front Yard need be provided on those Through Lots which abut on a primary, Major or Secondary Highway, as such highways are shown on the \u201cHighways and Freeways Element of the General Plan\u201d, when the rights to vehicular ingress and egress from such Through Lots to the highways have been abandoned or prohibited by a tract restriction.\u00a0 Where only one Front Yard is required on a Through Lot, as provided herein, the Rear Yard shall be located on the portion of such Lot adjacent to the highway.\tWhere a Through Lot is less than 150 feet in depth or is developed as a single Building site, and the two required Front Yards are provided, no Rear Yard is required.\t(5)\tFront Yard Paving.\u00a0 All portions of the required Front Yard not used for necessary driveways and walkways, including decorative walkways, shall be used for planting, and shall not otherwise be paved.\t(6)\tFront Yard on Lots Existing Prior

recording of a division of land map or otherwise in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations.\u00a0 On any such Lot, the originally required Front Yard shall be provided and maintained in addition to any new Front Yard required by any subsequent rearrangement of the Lot lines by sale or division (without recording a subdivision map) creating a new Lot fronting on a different Street than that on which the original Lot fronted.\t(7)\tSide and Rear Yards for Basements.\u00a0 In determining the required Side and Rear Yards of a Building, any Basement containing Habitable Rooms shall

Side Yard on each side of a main Building of not less than 5 feet.\u00a0 Where the Lot is less than 50 feet in width, the Side Yard may be reduced to 10% of the width of the Lot, but in no event less than 3 feet.\t(ii)\tIn lieu of the additional Side Yard requirement in Table 12.21 C.10-1, for a Building more than two-stories in height on Lots in the R1, RS, or RE Zone, one foot shall be added to the width of each required Side Yard for each additional Story above the second Story.\t(iii)\tOn a Lot in the RA Zone, where a Side Yard is less than 10 feet in width, and the Building erected on the Lot is three or more Stories in height, one foot shall be added to such Side Yard.\t(9)\tSide Yards in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in Subdivision Approvals.\u00a0 Side Yard requirements in Specific Plans, Historic Preservation Overlay Zones or in subdivision approvals shall take precedence over requirements of this Subdivision 10.\u00a0 Otherwise, this Subdivision shall apply.\t(10)\tEncroachments Into Required Yards.\u00a0 Every required Front, Side and Rear Yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for the following:\t(i)\tGarages in Front Yards.\u00a0 A Private Garage may be located on the required Front Yard of a Lot where the Elevation of the ground at a point 50 feet from the front Lot line of a Lot and midway between the side Lot lines differs 10 feet or more from the curb level, provided every portion of the garage Building is at least 5 feet from the front Lot line.\u00a0 Where the wall of such garage is two-thirds below natural or finished Grade of the Lot, whichever is lower, said wall may extend to the adjacent side Lot line; in all other cases, said garage shall not be nearer to the side Lot line than the width of the Side Yard required for a main Building of the same height.\t(ii)\tOpen, Unenclosed Stairways, Porches, Platforms, Landing Places, or Balconies.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, on Lots fronting onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, open unenclosed stairways, porches, platforms and landing places not covered by a roof or canopy shall not project or extend into the Front Yard.\u00a0 Balconies with 10 feet or more of vertical clearance beneath them may project or extend no more than 30 inches into a Front Yard.\t(iii)\tOther Exceptions.\u00a0 All of those
