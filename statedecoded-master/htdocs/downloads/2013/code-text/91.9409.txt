  INFORMATION REQUIRED ON PLANS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,258, Eff. 8/30/96.)91.9409.1.  General.  The licensed
engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the building shall
record the information required by this section on the approved plans. The plans
shall accurately reflect the results of the engineering investigation and design
and show all pertinent dimensions and sizes for plan review and construction.
The plans shall show existing framing construction, diaphragm construction,
proposed primary, alternate and secondary anchors, proposed shear walls and
collectors for the base  and below.  All structural elements that are part of
the design including existing nailing, anchors, ties, and collectors, shall be
shown on the plans.  The plans shall indicate existing construction that has
not been exposed and needs verification at the time of construction.91.9409.2. 
Building Elevations.  Elevations showing the existing conditions shall be drawn
to scale.  Elevations shall show roof and floor heights, dimensions of
openings, location and extent of existing damage, and proposed repair and
strengthening.91.9409.3.  Shear Walls.  Plans shall include all information
pertinent to shear walls, including typical wall panel thickness, length, and
the location and size of all anchors.91.9409.4.  Details.  Details shall
include the existing lateral bracing systems to be utilized including work
required for the lateral and vertical load systems and new anchors and the
method of development of anchor forces into the diaphragm framing.91.9409.5. 
Engineer’s or Architect’s Statement.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff.
12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  The responsible engineer or architect shall state on
the approved plans the following:	1.	“I am responsible for designing the
strengthening for this building’s base level and below in compliance with the
minimum regulations of Division 94 of the Los Angeles Building Code; and either
I or someone under my responsible charge has performed the pre-design
investigation.”	or when applicable:	2.	“The Registered Deputy Inspector,
required as a condition of the use of structural design stresses requiring
continuous inspection, will be responsible to me as required by Section 91.1704
of the Los Angeles Building Code.”TABLE 94-A
