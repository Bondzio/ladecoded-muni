FILLING AND DISPENSING PRECAUTIONS. (§ 57.44.16)

  FILLING AND DISPENSING PRECAUTIONS.	Where the service to any burner or
appliance has been interrupted or shut off, no person shall open any service
system supply valve after having supplied, transferred, or dispensed liquefied
flammable gas into any cylinder, tank, or system, without first having made
certain that all burner, pilot, and appliance valves are turned off.  When it
cannot be determined that all burner, pilot, and appliance valves are turned
off, such person shall leave the service system supply valve in a closed
position and a notification tag shall be attached to that valve advising that
the supply valve is in the off position and all burner, pilot, and appliance
valves must be checked before the supply valve is opened.
