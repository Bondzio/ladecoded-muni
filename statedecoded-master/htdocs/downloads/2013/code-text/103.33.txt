HEARING ON DENIAL – REQUEST BY APPLICANT. (§ 103.33)

  HEARING ON DENIAL – REQUEST BY APPLICANT.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 176,546, Eff. 5/2/05.)	Within ten days after service upon
him of a written notice of the intention of the Board to deny his application
for a permit, the applicant may file a request for a hearing with the Board. 
The request for a hearing shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the
applicant and shall state his mailing address.  It need not be verified or
follow any particular form.  Failure to file such a request for a hearing shall
constitute a waiver of the applicant’s right to a hearing.  The Board, in its
discretion, may nevertheless grant a hearing.  No further notice other than
notice of the date and place of hearing need be served on the applicant. 
Hearings granted under this section, except for permits subject to Sections
103.101.1, 103.102 and 103.109, shall be conducted substantially in compliance
with the provisions of Article 2 of Chapter 2 of this Code.  Hearings granted
under this section for permits subject to Sections 103.101.1, 103.102 and
103.109 shall be conducted substantially in compliance with the provisions of
Article 2, Chapter 10.
