	(Added by Ord. No. 171,074, Eff. 6/23/96.)

	On March 6, 1996, the Council of the City of Los Angeles adopted recommendations from the Housing and Community Redevelopment Committee to establish the Habitability Enforcement Program (&#x201C;HEP&#x201D;) substantially in conformance with the definitions and procedures outlined in a February 14, 1996 Department report.

	As stated in that report, &#x201C;HEP is built on the existing Rent Reduction and REAP programs.&#xA0; It is principally distinguished from the existing programs [because a] complaint alleging [a] habitability violation can be initiated by the tenant .&thinsp;.&thinsp;. [and it] allows a rent reduction and rent escrow order to be imposed in a much shorter time frame .&thinsp;.&thinsp;. &#x201D;

	HEP is a pilot program to be reviewed at the end of 18 months.&#xA0; During this 18 month period the Department will report to the Mayor and City Council and the Department, Department of Building and Safety, and the Fire Department will report to the Public Safety Committee on a quarterly basis on the progress of the pilot program and any recommendations for revisions to HEP.</full_text><order_by>01</order_by><ancestry><unit id="88" label="article"><name>Habitability Enforcement Program Of The City Of Los Angeles</name><identifier>3</identifier><url>/15/3/</url></unit><unit id="37" label="chapter"><name>Rent Stabilization Ordinance</name><identifier>15</identifier><url>/15/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="3891"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.00</section_number><catch_line>Title.</catch_line><url>/153.00/</url><token>153.00</token></unit><unit id="434"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.01</section_number><catch_line>Declaration Of Purpose.</catch_line><url>/153.01/</url><token>153.01</token></unit><unit id="3980"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.02</section_number><catch_line>Definitions.</catch_line><url>/153.02/</url><token>153.02</token></unit><unit id="1122"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.03</section_number><catch_line>Filing Of Complaint For Hep, Notification Of Landlord.</catch_line><url>/153.03/</url><token>153.03</token></unit><unit id="1934"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.04</section_number><catch_line>Landlord&#x2019;S Options.</catch_line><url>/153.04/</url><token>153.04</token></unit><unit id="3802"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.05</section_number><catch_line>Referral Of Property.</catch_line><url>/153.05/</url><token>153.05</token></unit><unit id="2757"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.06</section_number><catch_line>Review Of Hep.</catch_line><url>/153.06/</url><token>153.06</token></unit></structure_contents><next_section id="3980"><structure_id>88</structure_id><section_number>153.02</section_number><catch_line>Definitions.</catch_line><url>/153.02/</url><token>153.02</token></next_section><metadata></metadata><references></references><url>/153.01/</url><token>153.01</token><formats><txt>/153.01.txt</txt><json>/153.01.xml</json></formats><dublin_core><Title>Declaration Of Purpose.</Title><Type>Text</Type><Format>text/html</Format><Identifier>&#xA7; 153.01</Identifier><Relation>Los Angeles Municipal Code</Relation></dublin_core><plain_text>                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE
