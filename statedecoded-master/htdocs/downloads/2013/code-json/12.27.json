and\n\n\t5.\tthat the granting of the variance will not adversely affect any element of the General Plan.\n\n\tA variance shall not be used to grant a special privilege or to permit a use substantially inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the same zone and vicinity.\u00a0 The Zoning Administrator may deny a variance if the conditions creating the need for the variance were self-imposed.\n\n\tUpon making a decision, the Zoning Administrator shall transmit a copy of the written findings and decisions to the applicant, the Director of Planning, the Department of Building and Safety, owners of all properties abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner with the subject property and to all persons who have filed written requests for this notice with the Office of Zoning Administrator.\u00a0 The Zoning Administrator shall also place a copy of the findings and decision in the file.\n\n\tE.\tConditions of Approval.\u00a0 In approving a variance, the Zoning Administrator may impose those conditions it deems necessary to remedy a disparity of privileges and that the Zoning Administrator finds are necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare and assure compliance with the objectives of the General Plan and the purpose and intent of the zoning.\n\n\tF.\tTime to Act.\u00a0 The initial decision shall be made within 75 days of the submission of a complete application, or within an extended period as mutually agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the Zoning Administrator.\u00a0 An initial decision shall include the written findings made in accordance with Subsection D.\n\n\tG.\tFailure to Act -Transfer of Jurisdiction.\n\n\t1.\tIf the Zoning Administrator fails to act on an application for a variance within the time provided in Subsection F, the applicant may file a request for a transfer of jurisdiction to the Area Planning Commission for decision.\u00a0 The Director of Planning shall prescribe the form and manner of filing requests for transfers of jurisdiction.\u00a0 When an applicant requests that a matter be transferred, the Zoning Administrator may file with the Area Planning Commission a statement of facts pertaining to the matter, and shall transmit to the Area Planning Commission the files in the case.\n\n\t2.\tWhen the Area Planning Commission receives the applicant\u2019s request for a transfer of jurisdiction, the Zoning Administrator shall lose jurisdiction;

development plan may appeal that decision to the Area Planning Commission.\u00a0 The appeal shall be in writing upon forms provided by the Department of City Planning.\u00a0 The appeal shall set forth specifically the basis of the appeal and the reasons why the decision should be reversed or modified.\u00a0 The appeal shall be filed within 15 calendar days from the date of mailing of the Zoning Administrator\u2019s decision and shall include a filing fee pursuant to Section 19.01B of this Code.\u00a0 No fee shall be required for the filing of appeals by other aggrieved persons.\n\n\t2.\tReduction of Site.\u00a0 So long as the use approved by variance is continued, the entire approved site shall be retained for the approved use, and no portion of the site shall be severed or utilized for other purposes unless the plans for the reduced site are first submitted to and approved by a Zoning Administrator.\u00a0 The decision of a Zoning Administrator on a proposed reduction of the area of an approved site shall be subject to the same appeal as is provided for an application to establish the use.\n\n\t3.\tConditions of Approval.\u00a0 In connection with the approval of such plans, a Zoning Administrator may impose conditions on the same basis as provided for in this section in connection with the original variance.\n\n\t4.\tChange of Use.\u00a0 No use approved by variance may be changed in a different use for which a variance is otherwise required unless the new use is authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the
