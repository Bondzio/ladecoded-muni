AMENDMENTS TO THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INVENTORY FORM. (§ 57.08.07)

  AMENDMENTS TO THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INVENTORY FORM.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 172,043, Eff. 7/13/98.)	A business which has filed a
hazardous materials inventory form shall file an amendment to the Form with the
Department before:	A.	The business handles a hazardous substance not previously
listed on the Form on file with the Department; or	B.	The business handles
quantities of a hazardous substance which exceed the maximum quantities
previously indicated on the Form on file with the Department; or	C.	There is a
change in the mode or place of storage of hazardous substances from that
indicated on the Form on file with the Department such that continued reliance
on the information already contained in the Form on file could pose a threat to
the environment or to the health or safety of individuals.	In addition to the
above requirement, all businesses which are required to submit a hazardous
materials inventory form shall submit an annual inventory or a certification
statement.  An amendment submitted during the year to report changes in
inventory fulfills the annual submittal requirement provided that the amendment
contains the entire inventory, including those items which have not changed.
