PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE. (§ 57.43.12)

  PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE.	A.	Every special vessel operating at a pressure above
the atmospheric pressure of the vessel shall be equipped with at least one
approved pressure-relief device. If only one pressure-relief device is used, it
shall be set to operate at a pressure not to exceed the maximum allowable
working pressure of the vessel.  Additional relief devices may be set to
operate at a higher pressure but shall not exceed 120 percent of the maximum
allowable working pressure of the vessel.	B.	In determining the capacity of the
pressure-relief device, the heat transfer to the special vessel shall be based
on heat transfer through the insulation with the temperature outside of the
insulation assumed to be not less than 1600° F.	C.	The discharge from
pressure-relief devices or systems shall be at a safe location.  The following
shall be considered minimum requirements:	1.	Open discharges shall be so placed
and directioned that the outflow is directed away from the special vessel and
will not create a hazard over walkways, stairways. or operating platforms. 
Discharge shall be vertically upwards whenever possible.	2.	The point of
discharge shall be not less than 10 feet above the surrounding ground level, nor
less than two feet above the surface of the special vessel.
