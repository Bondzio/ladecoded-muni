however when a hearing examiner has been assigned to such hearing, no continuances may be granted except by that hearing examiner, for good cause shown, so long as the matter remains before the hearing examiner.\n\n\t(e)\tReporting.\u00a0 The proceedings at the hearing shall be reported by an electronic recording if requested by any party thereto.\u00a0 A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to all parties upon request and upon payment of the prescribed fee therefor.\n\n\t(f)\tOaths-Certification.\u00a0 In any proceedings under this division, the Board, any Board member, the secretary of the Board or the hearing examiner has the power to administer oaths and affirmations and to certify to official acts.\n\n\t(g)\tAppointment of Hearing Examiner(s).\u00a0 Whenever an appeal or protest is made to the Board pursuant to this section, the Board may appoint one or more hearing examiners or designate one or more of its members to serve as hearing examiners, and direct such hearing examiner or examiners to consider all or part of such appeal or protest or to conduct all or part of such hearing and to submit a report or reports thereon as hereafter provided. Hearing examiners may, be appointed from among the officers or employees of the City.\n\n\t(h)\tReport of Hearing Examiner.\u00a0 Within such period as may be fixed by the Board, the hearing examiner shall submit a written report to the Board.\u00a0 Such report shall contain a brief summary of the evidence considered and shall state the hearing examiner\u2019s conclusions and recommendations, and if the matter is then ready for decision, the report shall contain a proposed decision, in such form that it may be adopted by the Board as its decision in the case, and a brief statement of the hearing examiner\u2019s reasons therefor.\u00a0 All hearing examiner\u2019s reports shall be filed by the secretary of the Board as public records.\u00a0 A copy of each proposed decision so filed shall then be mailed by the Secretary of the Board to each party.\n\n\t(i)\tConsideration of Report by Board.\u00a0 The Board shall fix a time when the Board will consider the report of the hearing examiner.\u00a0 Notice thereof shall be mailed by the Board Secretary to each party not less than ten (10) days prior to the date fixed, unless otherwise stipulated. Not later than five (5) days before such date any party may file written exceptions to any part or all of the hearing examiner\u2019s report.\n\n\t(j)\tDisposition by Board.\n\n\t(1)\tAfter considering the hearing examiner\u2019s report and any exceptions, proposals, and arguments submitted, the Board may adopt, reject, or modify such report in whole or in part.\u00a0 If the matter is then ready for decision, the Board may proceed to make its decision.\n\n\t(2)\tIf the Board does not decide the matter upon the hearing examiner\u2019s report, the Board may itself consider the matter either in whole or in part, upon the record, including the transcript, or may decide the matter after itself receiving the whole or any part of the evidence or may refer part or all of the matter to the same or another hearing examiner.\u00a0 If part of the matter is so referred to an hearing examiner, such hearing examiner shall prepare and submit to the Board a report, including a proposed decision as provided in this section, upon the evidence heard by such hearing examiner, and the papers, records, and reports which are part of the record of the prior hearing, and thereafter the matter shall proceed as heretofore provided in the case of an original hearing examiner\u2019s report.\u00a0 If additional evidence is received by the Board itself, no member thereof may vote on the matter unless the member has heard the additional testimony or has read a reporter\u2019s transcript of the same, or if there was other additional evidence, unless the member has considered such other additional evidence.\u00a0 The Board shall give such notice of its decision as is provided or required in cases where it makes no reference to a hearing examiner.\n\n\t(k)\tDuty to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.\u00a0 A Septage Hauler has the legal obligation to exhaust administrative remedies.\u00a0 Failure of a Septage Hauler to pursue its appeal rights hereunder or to appeal the Director\u2019s decision is a waiver of such rights.\u00a0 Accordingly, any action of the Director which was subject to review by the Board under this subdivision, but was not appealed to the Board, shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil proceeding.\n\n\t7.\tJudicial Enforcement Remedies.\n\n\t(a)\tInjunctive Relief.\u00a0 Whenever a Septage Hauler has violated or continues to

section on activities of the Septage Hauler.\u00a0 The Director may also seek such other relief as may be appropriate including a requirement for the Septage Hauler to conduct environmental remediation.\u00a0 The petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against a Septage Hauler.\n\n\t(b)\tCivil Liability.\u00a0 Pursuant to Section 54740 of the Government Code, any person who violates conditions of a Septage Disposal Permit, this section, the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, any order issued hereunder, or any other

agency may petition the superior court to impose, assess, and recover such sums.\n\n\tRemedies under this section are in addition to and do not supersede or limit any and all other remedies, civil or criminal, but no liability shall be recoverable under this section for any violation for which liability is recovered under Subdivision 8 of this section.\n\n\t(c)\tCriminal Liability.\u00a0 It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any condition of a Septage Disposal Permit, this section, the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, or any order issued hereunder.\u00a0 Any person violating any of
