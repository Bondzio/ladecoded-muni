CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS AND INSTALLATION VERIFICATION.\n\n99.01.102.1.\u00a0 Submittal Documents.\u00a0 Construction documents and other data shall be submitted in one or more sets with each application for a permit.\u00a0 Where special conditions exist, the Department is authorized to require additional construction documents to be prepared by a licensed design professional and may be submitted separately.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 The Department is authorized to waive the submission of construction documents and other data not required to be prepared by a licensed design professional.\n\n99.01.102.2.\u00a0 Information on Construction Documents.\u00a0 Construction documents shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature and scope of the proposed green building feature and show that it will conform to the provisions of this code, the Los Angeles Building Standards Code and other relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations as determined by the Department.\u00a0 The construction document and other data submitted to the Department for checking shall be drawn with ink or indelible pencil, or shall be made by a reproducible process approved by the Department.\n\n99.01.102.3.\u00a0 Verification.\u00a0 Documentation of conformance for applicable green building measures shall be provided to the Department.\u00a0 Alternate methods of documentation shall be acceptable when the Department finds that the proposed alternate documentation is satisfactory to demonstrate substantial conformance with the intent of the proposed green

approval on all applicable sheets of each set.\n\n99.01.102.5.\u00a0 Validity of Approval.\u00a0 The stamping or approval of any construction document or other data shall not be held to permit, or to be an approval of, the violation of any provision of this code.\n\n99.01.102.6.\u00a0 Alterations to Stamped Construction Documents.\u00a0 No stamped or approved set of construction documents or data shall be altered in any manner, except when and as approved by the Department.\n\n99.01.102.7.\u00a0 Stamped Plans on Job.\u00a0 The stamped set of construction documents and other data shall be kept

document, or other data without the Department\u2019s approval.\n\n99.01.102.8.\u00a0 Validity of Permit.\u00a0 The issuance of a permit is not an approval or an authorization of the work specified therein.\u00a0 A permit is merely an application for inspection, the issuance of which entitles the permittee to inspection of the work which is described therein.\n\n\tPermits issued under the requirements of this code shall not relieve the owner of responsibility for securing required permits for work to be done which is regulated by any other code, department or division of the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\tAll permits are issued subject to the following conditions:\n\n\tIf the work described by a valid permit is prohibited by a change in the Los Angeles Municipal Code, then such work may be completed only if the Department determined that both substantial liabilities have been incurred, and substantial work has been performed on site, in accordance with the terms of that permit.\u00a0 Work performed and liabilities incurred pursuant to a demolition or relocation permit shall not be considered in determining whether an owner may complete a building or structure for which a building permit has been issued.\n\n99.01.102.9.\u00a0 Validity of Other Laws.\u00a0 Neither the issuance of a permit nor the approval by the Department of any document shall constitute an approval of any violation of any provision of this code or of any other law or ordinance, and a permit or other document purporting to give authority to violate any law shall not be valid with respect thereto.\n\n99.01.102.10.\u00a0 Making False Statements to the Department.\u00a0 Any person who willfully or knowingly, with the intent to deceive, makes a false statement or representation, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact in any documentation required by the Department, including any oral or written evidence presented, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.","order_by":"01.102","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"14","name":"Green Building Code","identifier":"9","label":"article","url":"\/9\/9\/"},"2":{"id":"3","name":"Building
