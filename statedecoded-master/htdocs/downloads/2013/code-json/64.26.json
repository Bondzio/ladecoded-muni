No. 160,388, Eff. 10\/21\/85.)\n\n\tA.\tGeneral Provisions.\n\n\t1.\tPurpose. The purpose of this section is to protect and preserve the water quality of the groundwater basins located generally in the San Fernando Valley and certain adjacent areas by phasing out the use of private sewage disposal systems employed by commercial and industrial uses, and in multiple residential units. The continued use of private sewage disposal systems by commercial and industrial uses in the San Fernando Valley and certain adjacent areas is declared to be a threat to the quality of the ground water and to the public health. Therefore, the City is providing a systematic method of requiring both the connection to public sewers and permanent abandonment of private sewage disposal systems.\n\n\t2.\tScope. This section shall apply to all private sewage disposal systems in the City of Los Angeles located northerly of the boundary line described as follows:\n\n\tBeginning from the west at the intersection of Mulholland Highway and the City boundary, thence along Mulholland Highway in a northerly direction to the intersection with Mulholland Drive, thence along Mulholland Drive in an easterly direction to the intersection of Mulholland Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard, thence northerly along Laurel Canyon Boulevard to the intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and the Los Angeles River, thence along the Los Angeles River in an easterly and then southerly direction to the intersection of the Los Angeles River and the Glendale Freeway, thence along the Glendale Freeway in a northerly direction to the City boundary.\n\n\tB.\tDefinitions.\u00a0 For purposes of this section, \u201cNotice to Connect\u201d shall mean a notice to connect to a public sewer and to abandon a Private Sewage Disposal System (PSDS) as defined at Number 42.5 in Section 64.00 of this Code.\n\n\tC.\tIssuance Of Notice To Connect To The Public Sewer And To Abandon A PSDS.\n\n\t1.\tIssuance by Director.\u00a0 When connection to a public sewer is available or becomes available for a lot upon which a PSDS is located, the Director shall issue a Notice to Connect to the owner of the lot as identified on the Los Angeles County equalized assessment roll or as known to the City Engineer.\u00a0 The Director may, in addition, issue a copy of a Notice to Connect to any person using or maintaining the PSDS.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff. 4\/10\/11.)\n\n\t(a)\tWhen Sewer is \u201cAvailable\u201d. A public sewer is available when it is located in any public street or easement abutting a lot.\n\n\t(b)\tPhasing. The Board shall adopt standards for the issuance of Notices to Connect to be administered on a phased basis. The standards shall permit the Director to give priority to lots located in areas where the Department of Water and Power has determined the underlying groundwater has been contaminated by industrial chemicals.\n\n\t(c)\tExemption. If a PSDS is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and is located on a lot occupied by four or fewer units which are used solely for residential purposes, it shall be exempt from the requirements of this section and the Director shall not issue a Notice to Connect for such PSDS.\n\n\t2.\tTime for Compliance. The Notice to Connect shall be fully complied with no later than one year from the date of issuance of the Notice to Connect, provided however, that if the Director finds that a PSDS is not in compliance with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, the Notice to Connect shall provide for full compliance within 30 days of the issuance of the Notice to Connect.\n\n\t3.\tContents of a Notice to Connect.

If full compliance with the requirements of a Notice to Connect has not been achieved four months prior to the date specified for such full compliance in the Notice to Connect, the Director shall issue a Reminder Notice which shall repeat the deadline for compliance and the possible sanctions for failure to comply;\n\n\t(b)\tFinal Notice. If full compliance with the requirements of a Notice to Connect has not been achieved one month prior to the date specified for such full compliance in the Notice to Connect, the Director shall issue a Final Notice which shall repeat the deadline for compliance and the possible sanctions for failure to comply.\n\n\t5.\tService of Notices.
