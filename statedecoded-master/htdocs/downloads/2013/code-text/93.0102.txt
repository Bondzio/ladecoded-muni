                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE

PURPOSE. (§ 93.0102)

  PURPOSE.	(a)	The purpose of this Code is to reduce the personnel hazard and
the fire hazard from electrical causes. To accomplish this, the requirements set
forth herein are intended to provide a minimum standard for electrical
installations in the City of Los Angeles.	(b)	Whenever compliance with the
provisions of this Code fail to reduce the demonstrable hazards due to
electrical causes to an acceptable level and the hazard is such that the time
required to effect a change through normal processes would not be in the common
interest, the Superintendent of the Department may require additional safeguards
to meet the intent and purpose of this Code.
