	5.1.4. Fire Department Connections. Fire Department connections for one and two family dwellings shall meet the following requirements:

	1.	A Fire Department connection shall be provided for any system protecting over 10,000 square feet of habitable space;

	2.	A single Fire Department connection pipe may be as small as the sprinkler riser, provided the riser is three inches or smaller; and

	3.	The hose inlet fitting may be 1-1/2 inches with 1.5-9 N.H. thread of 2.5-7.5 N.H. standard threads.

94.2014.6. Section 6.2 is added and modified to read as follows:

	6.2. Water Supply Sources.&#xA0; When the requirements of 6.2.2 are met, the following water supply sources shall be considered to be acceptable by this standard:

	1.	A connection to a reliable waterworks system with or without an automatically operated pump;

	2.	An elevated tank;

	3.	A pressure tank designed to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards for a pressure vessel with a reliable pressure source;

	4.	A stored water source with an automatically operated pump; and

	5.	A well with a pump of sufficient capacity and pressure to meet the sprinkler demand.&#xA0; The stored water requirement of 6.1.2 or 6.1.3 shall be permitted to be a combination of the water in the well (including the refill rate) plus the water in the holding tank if such tank can supply the sprinkler system.

94.2014.7. NFPA 13D-2010 Section 6.2.2 is added and modified to read as follows:

	6.2.2. Where a well, pump, tank or combination thereof&#xA0; is the source of supply for a fire sprinkler system, the water supply shall serve both domestic and fire sprinkler systems, and the following shall be met:

	1.	A test connection shall be provided downstream of the pump that creates a flow of water equal to the smallest sprinkler on the system. The connection shall return water to the tank;

	2.	Any disconnecting means for the pump shall be approved;

	3.	A method for refilling the tank shall be piped to the tank;

	4.	A method of seeing the water level in the tank shall be provided without having to open the tank; and

	5.	The pump shall not be permitted to sit directly on the floor.

94.2014.8. NFPA 13D-2010 Section 6.2.2.1 is added and modified to read as follows:

	6.2.2.1. Where a fire sprinkler system is supplied by a stored water source with an automatically operated means of pressurizing the system other than an electric pump, the water supply may serve the sprinkler system only.

94.2014.9. NFPA 13D-2010 Section 6.2.4 is added and modified to read as follows:

	6.2.4. Where a water supply serves both domestic and fire sprinkler systems, 5 gpm (19 L/min) shall be added to the sprinkler system demand at the point where the systems are connected, to determine the size of common piping and the size of the total water supply requirements where no provision is made to prevent flow into the domestic water system upon operation of a sprinkler.

94.2014.10. NFPA 13D-2010 Section 7.5.1 is added and modified to read as follows:

	7.5.1. Listed residential sprinklers shall be used unless another type is permitted by Sections 7.5.3 or 7.5.4.

94.2014.11. NFPA 13D-2010 Section 8.1.2 is added and modified to read as follows:

	8.1.2. Number of Design Sprinklers. The number of design sprinklers shall include all sprinklers within a compartment, up to a maximum of two sprinklers, under a flat, smooth, horizontal ceiling. For compartments containing two or more sprinklers, calculations shall be provided to verify the single operating criteria and the two operating sprinkler criteria.

	EXCEPTIONS:

	1.	Single family dwellings having more than 10,000 square feet of habitable space shall follow the design requirements of Section 94.2013 of this Division.

	2.	Attached private garages greater than 1500 square feet shall follow the design requirements of Section 94.2010 of this Division.

	3.	When listed quick response sprinklers are utilized within a dwelling, the hydraulic design shall follow the requirements of Section 94.2010 of this Division.

94.2014.12. NFPA 13D-2010 Section 8.1.3.1.2 is not adopted.
