Ord. No. 165,507, Eff. 3/25/90.) &#xA0; Any person whose dog or other animal has
been declared dangerous or whose license or permit has been revoked pursuant to
this section shall not have the privilege to own, posses, control or be in
charge of any animal of the species whose license or permit has been revoked or
whose animal has been declared dangerous for a period of three (3) years from
