No. 168, 230, Eff. 10\/11\/92.)\n\n\t(a)\tFindings.\u00a0 As a result of the civil disturbance that commenced on April 29, 1992, consumers have sought to purchase emergency supplies, food and other consumer goods necessary for their health and safety.\u00a0 Though no general shortage of consumer goods is evident, numerous residents have reported cases of excessive price increases for consumer items such as gasoline and food items many times above the prices in effect on or before April 29, 1992.\u00a0 Though price increases may be necessary where a merchant has incurred higher expenses, the reported price increases clearly exceed those that would be reasonable and just to recapture any increased operational expenses.\n\n\t(b)\tLegislative Intent.\u00a0 It is the intention of the City Council in adopting this ordinance to protect citizens from excessive and unjustified increases in the prices charged during any abnormal disruption of the marketplace for consumer goods and services vital and necessary for the health, safety and welfare of consumers resulting from emergency or major disaster for which a state of emergency for the City of Los Angeles is proclaimed by the Mayor pursuant to Section 8.27 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code or for which a local disaster or emergency is declared by the President of the United Sates or the Governor of California.\n\n\t(c)\tExcessive Price Increases Prohibited.\u00a0 Upon proclamation of public emergency involving or threatening the lives, property or welfare of the citizens, pursuant to Section 8.27 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code or for which a local disaster or emergency is declared by the President of the United States or Governor of California and for a period of thirty days from the date such declaration is terminated, it shall be unlawful for any person, contractor, business or other entity to sell or offer to sell any consumer food items, repair or reconstruction services, emergency or medical supplies or gasoline for an amount which exceeds ten percent of the price charged by such person, contractor, business or other entity for said goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation of emergency, unless said person, business, contractor or other entity can prove that an increase in price was directly attributable to additional costs imposed on it by the supplier of the goods or for labor and materials used to provide the service.\n\n\t(d)\tDefinitions.\u00a0 For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\t1.\tA consumer food item is any article which is used or intended for use for food, drink, confection or condiment by man or other animal.\n\n\t2.\tRepair or reconstruction services are those contractor services for repairs to residential and commercial property of any type which are damaged as a result of a disaster.\u00a0 Contractor services are services as defined by sections 7025, 7026, 7026.1 and 7026.3 of the California Business and Professions Code.\n\n\t3.\tEmergency supplies shall include but are not limited to water, flashlights, radios, batteries, candles, blankets, soaps, and diapers.\n\n\t4.\tMedical supplies shall include but are not limited to prescription and non-prescription drugs, bandages, gauzes, and isopropyl alcohol.\n\n\t(e)\tHearing.\u00a0 If there is reasonable cause to believe that a person has violated the provisions of this section, the City Attorney shall, prior to the filing of a criminal complaint, conduct a hearing upon due notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u00a0 At the conclusion of such hearing, the City Attorney may, in his discretion, file a criminal complaint.\u00a0 The City Attorney may, for good cause, disperse with the requirement of conducting a hearing prior to the filing of a criminal complaint.\n\n\t(f)\tPenalty.\n\n\t1.\tAny person who shall be convicted of violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000 or by imprisonment in the County Jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u00a0 Any person believing that a violation of said section has been committed may file a complaint with the City Attorney.\n\n\t2.\tThe City Attorney or any citizen may prosecute a civil action under applicable state law to enforce this section and in any action a civil penalty may be imposed as provided by law and where appropriate, restitution to aggrieved consumers
