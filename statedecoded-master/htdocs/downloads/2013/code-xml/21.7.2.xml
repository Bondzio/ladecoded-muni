	(c)	Occupancy.&#xA0; &#x201C;Occupancy&#x201D; means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be considered &#x201C;occupancy&#x201D; within the meaning of this definition unless the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

	(d)	Transient.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 164,961, Eff. 7/24/89, Oper. 8/1/89.)&#xA0; &#x201C;Transient&#x201D; means:

	1.	Any person, other than an individual, who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement, for any period of time, or

	2.	Any individual who personally exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement, for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days.&#xA0; Any such individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.

	Nothing in this definition or in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the operator of a hotel from refunding or making an allowance of credit to a person who has paid tax as required by this article where it is established that the person was not a &#x201C;transient&#x201D; as defined in this section or was exempt from the tax for any other reason, or had for any reason overpaid the tax.

	(e)	Rent. &#x201C;Rent&#x201D; means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

A secondary operator shall be deemed an operator for purposes of this article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as the principal operator, including but not limited to the collection and remittance of the full amount of the tax owed under the provisions of this article to the City.&#xA0; A secondary operator may satisfy its obligations under the provisions of this article by submitting the full amount of tax due under this article, with credit for any taxes remitted to any other operator, either directly to the Director of Finance or through the principal operator.&#xA0; The principal operator may satisfy any potential liability it may have for taxes owed by a secondary operator by entering into a legally binding agreement with that secondary operator to remit the portion of the tax owed by the secondary operator directly to the City.&#xA0; Upon request, the principal operator shall provide the Director of Finance with copies of any such agreements.

Compliance with the provisions of this article by either the principal operator or the secondary operator shall be deemed compliance by both and no provision of this article shall be deemed to require the payment and/or remittance of any amount other than the full amount of the tax owed by the transient.</full_text><order_by>7.2</order_by><ancestry><unit id="81" label="article"><name>Transient Occupancy Tax</name><identifier>1.7</identifier><url>/2/1.7/</url></unit><unit id="1" label="chapter"><name>Licenses, Permits, Business Regulations</name><identifier>2</identifier><url>/2/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="1760"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.1</section_number><catch_line>Title.</catch_line><url>/21.7.1/</url><token>21.7.1</token></unit><unit id="330"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.10</section_number><catch_line>Assessment &#x2013; Administrative Remedy.</catch_line><url>/21.7.10/</url><token>21.7.10</token></unit><unit id="366"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.11</section_number><catch_line>Records.</catch_line><url>/21.7.11/</url><token>21.7.11</token></unit><unit id="3791"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.12</section_number><catch_line>Refunds.</catch_line><url>/21.7.12/</url><token>21.7.12</token></unit><unit id="813"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.13</section_number><catch_line>Actions To Collect.</catch_line><url>/21.7.13/</url><token>21.7.13</token></unit><unit id="1649"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.2</section_number><catch_line>Definitions.</catch_line><url>/21.7.2/</url><token>21.7.2</token></unit><unit id="1099"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.3</section_number><catch_line>Tax Imposed.</catch_line><url>/21.7.3/</url><token>21.7.3</token></unit><unit id="4141"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.4</section_number><catch_line>Exemptions.</catch_line><url>/21.7.4/</url><token>21.7.4</token></unit><unit id="1155"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.5</section_number><catch_line>Operator&#x2019;S Duties.</catch_line><url>/21.7.5/</url><token>21.7.5</token></unit><unit id="1578"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.6</section_number><catch_line>Registration.</catch_line><url>/21.7.6/</url><token>21.7.6</token></unit><unit id="463"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.7</section_number><catch_line>Reporting And Remitting.</catch_line><url>/21.7.7/</url><token>21.7.7</token></unit><unit id="602"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.8</section_number><catch_line>Penalties And Interest.</catch_line><url>/21.7.8/</url><token>21.7.8</token></unit><unit id="3657"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.9</section_number><catch_line>Additional Powers And Duties Of Director Of Finance, Etc.</catch_line><url>/21.7.9/</url><token>21.7.9</token></unit></structure_contents><next_section id="1099"><structure_id>81</structure_id><section_number>21.7.3</section_number><catch_line>Tax Imposed.</catch_line><url>/21.7.3/</url><token>21.7.3</token></next_section><metadata></metadata><references></references><url>/21.7.2/</url><token>21.7.2</token><formats><txt>/21.7.2.txt</txt><json>/21.7.2.xml</json></formats><dublin_core><Title>Definitions.</Title><Type>Text</Type><Format>text/html</Format><Identifier>&#xA7; 21.7.2</Identifier><Relation>Los Angeles Municipal Code</Relation></dublin_core><plain_text>                            LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE
