	For the purpose of this article the following words and phrases are defined as follows:

	Alley &#x2013; A public way, other than a street or highway, providing a means of vehicular access to abutting property;

	Appeal Board &#x2013; The Area Planning Commission where the map is located for any parcel map or tentative map that:&#xA0; (a) creates or results in less than 50,000 gross square feet of nonresidential floor area; or (b) creates or results in fewer than 50 dwelling units, guest rooms, or combination of dwelling units and guest rooms; or (c) involves a lot with fewer than 65,000 square feet of lot area.&#xA0; Otherwise, the City Planning Commission.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5/20/12.)

	Average Natural Slope. (Amended by Ord. No. 179,035, Eff. 9/17/07.)&#xA0; The average of the ungraded slopes at selected contours within a given parcel of land divided by its area as computed from either the City&#x2019;s Engineer&#x2019;s topographic maps or a topographic map prepared by a California registered civil engineer or California licensed land surveyor.&#xA0; Regardless of which map is used, calculations cannot be derived or interpolated from a map that originally had contour intervals of greater than 25 feet for subdivisions or greater than five feet for parcel maps.&#xA0; Average natural slope shall be computed by the following formula:



	Where:	 S&#xA0; =	average natural slope in percent.

		 C&#xA0; =	contour interval in feet, at no greater than 25-foot intervals for subdivisions or five-foot intervals for parcel maps, resulting in at least five contour lines.

		 L&#xA0; =	total accumulated length of all contours of interval &#x201C;C&#x201D; in feet.

		 A&#xA0; =	the area being considered in square feet.

	Slopes may be computed only by the entire subdivision or parcel map area.&#xA0; The calculation &#x201C;L&#x201D; (contour lengths) and &#x201C;A&#x201D; (area in square feet) can be computed by 500-foot grid increments, as shown on the City Engineer&#x2019;s topographic maps.&#xA0; The &#x201C;L&#x201D; for each grid increment must be added to the &#x201C;L&#x201D; for every other grid increment and the &#x201C;A&#x201D; for each grid increment must be added to the &#x201C;A&#x201D; for every other grid increment to determine the &#x201C;L&#x201D; and the &#x201C;A&#x201D; for the entire subdivision or parcel map, prior to calculating the average natural slope for that subdivision or parcel map.&#xA0; In any matter where the average natural slope is used to calculate density pursuant to Sections 17.05 or 17.50 of this Code, the subdivision file shall contain copies of all maps and all calculations so that the figures can be verified.&#xA0; All maps and all calculations are required to be submitted at the time of the filing of a subdivision application or the application is deemed incomplete.

DEFINITIONS. (&#xA7; 17.02)

&#xA0; DEFINITIONS.	For the purpose of this article the following words and phrases
are defined as follows:	Alley &#x2013; A public way, other than a street or highway,
providing a means of vehicular access to abutting property;	Appeal Board &#x2013; The
Area Planning Commission where the map is located for any parcel map or
tentative map that:&#xA0; (a) creates or results in less than 50,000 gross square
feet of nonresidential floor area; or (b) creates or results in fewer than 50
dwelling units, guest rooms, or combination of dwelling units and guest rooms;
or (c) involves a lot with fewer than 65,000 square feet of lot area.&#xA0;
Otherwise, the City Planning Commission.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff.
5/20/12.)	Average Natural Slope. (Amended by Ord. No. 179,035, Eff. 9/17/07.)&#xA0;
The average of the ungraded slopes at selected contours within a given parcel of
land divided by its area as computed from either the City&#x2019;s Engineer&#x2019;s
topographic maps or a topographic map prepared by a California registered civil
engineer or California licensed land surveyor.&#xA0; Regardless of which map is
used, calculations cannot be derived or interpolated from a map that originally
had contour intervals of greater than 25 feet for subdivisions or greater than
five feet for parcel maps.&#xA0; Average natural slope shall be computed by the
following formula:	Where:	 S&#xA0; =	average natural slope in percent.		 C&#xA0;
=	contour interval in feet, at no greater than 25-foot intervals for
subdivisions or five-foot intervals for parcel maps, resulting in at least five
contour lines.		 L&#xA0; =	total accumulated length of all contours of interval
&#x201C;C&#x201D; in feet.		 A&#xA0; =	the area being considered in square feet.	Slopes may be
computed only by the entire subdivision or parcel map area.&#xA0; The calculation
&#x201C;L&#x201D; (contour lengths) and &#x201C;A&#x201D; (area in square feet) can be computed by
500-foot grid increments, as shown on the City Engineer&#x2019;s topographic maps.&#xA0;
The &#x201C;L&#x201D; for each grid increment must be added to the &#x201C;L&#x201D; for every other
grid increment and the &#x201C;A&#x201D; for each grid increment must be added to the
&#x201C;A&#x201D; for every other grid increment to determine the &#x201C;L&#x201D; and the &#x201C;A&#x201D;
for the entire subdivision or parcel map, prior to calculating the average
natural slope for that subdivision or parcel map.&#xA0; In any matter where the
average natural slope is used to calculate density pursuant to Sections 17.05 or
17.50 of this Code, the subdivision file shall contain copies of all maps and
all calculations so that the figures can be verified.&#xA0; All maps and all
calculations are required to be submitted at the time of the filing of a
subdivision application or the application is deemed incomplete.	Board -(Deleted
by Ord. No. 173,268, Eff. 7/1/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)	Building Site &#x2013; Any parcel of
land which conforms to the definition of a lot as defined in this article.	City
Engineer &#x2013; The City Engineer.	Commission &#x2013; (Deleted by Ord. No. 173,106,

alignments, grades and widths;	(2)	drainage and sanitary facilities and
utilities, including alignments and grades thereof;	(3)	location and size of all
required easements and rights&#x2013;of&#x2013;way;	(4)	fire roads and firebreaks:	(5)	lot
and size configuration;	(6)	traffic access;	(7)	grading;	(8)	land to be
dedicated for park and recreation purposes, and	(9)	such other specific
