and\n\n\t3.\tCompliance with all of the applicable requirements of Subsection (h) below.\n\n\t(h)\tConditions to Issuance of Permit.\u00a0 The Board may condition the issuance of a permit by imposing reasonable requirements concerning the time, place, and manner of the Event, as necessary to protect the safety of all persons and property, provided that the conditions shall not unreasonably restrict the right of free speech.\u00a0 These conditions include, but are not limited to:\n\n\t1.\tAlteration of the date or time of the Event proposed on the application;\n\n\t2.\tAlteration of the location of the Assembly, route of the Parade, and\/or the area and manner of assembling and disbanding of the Parade;\n\n\t3.\tAccommodation of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including restricting the Event to only a portion of a street or highway;\n\n\t4.\tCompliance with all ordinances or laws and obtaining all legally required permits or licenses;\n\n\t5.\tRequirements for the training and

upon the streets or highways).\n\n\t(i)\tGrounds for Denial of Application or Revocation of a Permit.\n\n\t1.\tThe Board, through either the Executive Director or the Designated Police Commissioner, shall approve an application for a permit unless it determines from a consideration of the application or other pertinent information, the existence of any of the following, any of which shall also be justification for the Board to revoke a previously issued permit:\n\n\tA.\tInformation contained in the application, or supplementary information requested from the applicant, is false in any material detail;\n\n\tB.\tThe applicant failed to provide a complete application after being notified of the requirement of producing additional information or documents;\n\n\tC.\tThe Event will interfere with another Event, street closure or other activity for which a permit has previously been granted;\n\n\tD.\tThe concentration of persons, animals and\/or vehicles at the site of the Event, or at the assembly and disbanding areas, will prevent proper police, fire, ambulance, or other public services to areas contiguous to the Event;\n\n\tE.\tThe time, route or size of the Event will disrupt to an unreasonable extent the safe and expeditious movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street or highway when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion;\n\n\tF.\tThe size or duration of the Event will require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the City that providing the minimum level of police services to other areas of the City is jeopardized.\u00a0 Nothing in this paragraph authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect Event participants from the conduct of others;\n\n\tG.\tThe Event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the affected City streets or highways, or a previously granted encroachment permit;\u00a0\n\n\tH.\tThe parade will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in five hours or less;\n\n\tI.\tThe length of the parade route exceeds 3 miles from its point of origin to its point of termination; or\n\n\tJ.\tThe applicant fails to conduct the Event in accordance with the information contained in the permit application, or any terms and conditions imposed on the issued permit.\n\n\t2.\tWhen the grounds for denial of the application for a permit specified in Subdivision (i)1. can be corrected by altering the time, place and\/or manner of the Event as authorized by Subsection (h), the Board shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application provided the applicant accepts such conditions for permit issuance.\u00a0 The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modifications of the applicant\u2019s proposed Event as are necessary to achieve compliance with this subsection.\n\n\t(j)\tAppeal Procedure.\n\n\t1.\tRight to Appeal.\u00a0 The applicant shall have the right to appeal any permit conditions imposed upon an Event or the denial of a permit application.\u00a0 The applicant shall also have the right to appeal the amount of traffic control fees or clean-up deposits imposed pursuant to subsection (l).\n\n\t2.\tNotice of Appeal.\u00a0 A notice of appeal stating the grounds for the appeal shall be filed with the Board no later than three days after delivery of the notice of the denial of the application or notice of the contested\/disputed permit conditions.\n\n\t3.\tHearing by the Board.\n\n\tA.\tIf an applicant files a notice of appeal, the Board shall conduct a hearing on the appeal at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.\u00a0 The Board shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a continuance.\u00a0 The decision of the Board is final.\n\n\tB.\tIf the date of the next scheduled meeting of the Board following the receipt of a notice of appeal is later than two business days before the date of the scheduled Event, the Board shall convene a special meeting within 24 hours of the delivery of the notice of appeal.\u00a0 Notice of the time and place of said special meeting shall be given to all parties at least 24 hours prior to said hearing.\u00a0 The Board shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a continuance.\u00a0 The decision of the Board is final.\n\n\tC.\tNo Board member who did not hear the evidence or who was not read or heard the record or proceedings shall vote on the decision.\n\n\t(k)\tContents of Permit.\u00a0 In each permit, the Board shall prescribe:\n\n\t1.\tThe assembly area and time therefor:\n\n\t2.\tThe start time;\n\n\t3.\tThe minimum and maximum speeds for the Parade;\n\n\t4.\tThe exact route of the Parade;\n\n\t5.\tWhat portions of streets to be traversed may be occupied by the Event;\n\n\t6.\tThe maximum number of units and the maximum and minimum interval of space to be maintained between the units of the Parade;\n\n\t7.\tThe maximum length of the Parade in miles or fractions thereof;\n\n\t8.\tThe disbanding area and disbanding time;\n\n\t9.\tThe number of persons required to officiate and\/or monitor the Event;\n\n\t10.\tThe number and type of vehicles, if any;\n\n\t11.\tThe material and maximum size of any sign, banner, placard or carrying device therefor; and\n\n\t12.\tAll conditions imposed upon the Event pursuant to Subsection (h) of this Section.\n\n\t (l)\tFees and Indemnification.\n\n\t1.\tEach applicant, and any other person, organization, firm or corporation on whose behalf the application is made, shall be required to agree in writing to jointly and separately indemnify, protect and defend and hold harmless the City of Los Angeles, its officers and employees against all claims, damages, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of the permittee, its officers, agents or employees in connection with the Parade or Assembly.\n\n\t2.\tTraffic Control Costs.\n\n\tA.\tPrepayment of Costs.\u00a0 Upon approval by the Board of a permit for a Parade or Assembly but prior to the date of the scheduled Event, the Department of Transportation, through the Bureau of Street Services, shall provide the applicant with a statement of the estimated cost of providing traffic management at the Event.\u00a0 The applicant\/sponsor shall be required to pay the traffic control costs either prior to the date of the Event or within 15 days thereafter.\u00a0 Traffic control consists of clearing the parade\/assembly route of unauthorized vehicles, posting any parking restrictions necessary for the Event, diverting traffic around the Event, and directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic along the route of a parade.\n\n\tB.\tComputing Traffic Control Costs.\u00a0 The traffic control costs shall be computed by determining the number of LADOT personnel who will be required for traffic control beyond that which would otherwise be required at that time, multiplied by the number of hours for which such additional service is rendered at the rate of the City\u2019s full cost of providing officers on an hourly basis as established by the Department of Transportation.\n\n\tC.\tRefunds or Additional Charges.\u00a0 If the actual cost for traffic control on the date of the Event is less than the estimated cost pursuant to Subdivision (l)2.A. above, the applicant\/ sponsor will be refunded the difference by the City.\u00a0 If more traffic officers\u2019 hours are required than originally charged, the applicant\/sponsor will be billed the additional costs.\n\n\tD.\tTraffic control costs shall not be assessed if the size of the parade\/assembly can be controlled by 5 or fewer traffic officers over a two-hour period, as determined by LADOT.\n\n\t3.\tClean-up Deposit.\n\n\tA.\tThe applicant\/sponsor of an Event involving horses or other large animals, the sale of food or beverages, or the erection of any structure shall be required to provide a clean-up deposit prior to the date of the Event, paid to the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Services.\u00a0 The clean-up deposit shall be in the amount established in a cleanup fee schedule adopted by the City Council.\n\n\tB.\tThe clean-up deposit shall be returned after the Event if the area used for the Event has been cleaned and restored to the same condition as existed prior to the Event, as determined by a representative of the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Services.\n\n\tC.\tIf the property used for the Event has not been cleaned or restored, the permittee shall be billed for the actual cost of the clean-up and restoration by the Office of Finance, and the clean-up deposit or portion thereof shall be applied toward the payment of the bill.\n\n\tD.\tIf the permittee disputes the bill, he or she may appeal to the Board of Public Works within 5 days after receipt of the bill.\u00a0 Should there be any unexpended balance on the deposit after completion of the work, this balance shall be promptly refunded to the permittee.\u00a0 Should the amount of the bill exceed the clean-up deposit, the difference shall become due and payable to the City upon the applicant\u2019s receipt of the bill.\n\n\t4.\tWaiver of Fees for Traffic Control and Clean-up Services.\u00a0 Upon receipt of an application therefor to the Bureau of Street Services One Stop Special Events Permit Office, Traffic Control and Clean-up Services costs shall be waived for non-commercial Parades and Assemblies, so long as the particular event would qualify for a waiver applying all of the requirements, conditions and criteria set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.\u00a0 Applications for such waivers shall be processed as set forth in Municipal Code Sections 41.20 and 41.20.1.\n\n\t(m)\tWaiver.\u00a0 Except as specifically set forth herein, no requirements of this Section shall be waived.\n\n\t(n)\tViolation.\u00a0 Willful violation of any of the provisions of this Section, or the terms or conditions of an Event permit by the permittee or any participant in said Event is a misdemeanor.\n\n\t(o)\tSeverability.\u00a0 If any subsection, subdivision. sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this section, or the application thereof to any person, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Section or its application to other persons.\u00a0 The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted this section and each subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions, or the application thereof to any person, be declared invalid or unconstitutional.","order_by":"111","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"33","name":"Police Permit Regulation","identifier":"3","label":"article","url":"\/10\/3\/"},"2":{"id":"29","name":"Business

become due and payable to the City upon the applicant\u2019s\nreceipt of the bill.\t4.\tWaiver of Fees for Traffic Control and Clean-up\nServices.\u00a0 Upon receipt of an application therefor to the
