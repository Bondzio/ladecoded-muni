No. 150,799, Eff. 6\/5\/78.)\n\n\tA.\tRequirement.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 150,799, Eff. 6\/5\/78.)\u00a0 No building or structure shall be erected or enlarged, and no building permit shall be issued therefor, on any lot in any R3 or less restrictive zone (as such order of restrictiveness is set forth in Subsection B of Section 12.23); or on any lot in the RD1.5, RD2 or RD3 Zones; if such lot abuts a major or secondary highway or collector street unless the one-half of the highway or collector street which is located on the same side of the center of the highway or collector street as such lot has been dedicated and improved for the full width of the lot so as to meet the standards for such highway or collector street provided in Subsection H of this section; and further provided that in the case of either a corner lot or an L-shaped interior lot abutting a major or secondary highway and a local street which intersect, that one-half of the local street, on the same side of the center of said local street as such lot, has been dedicated and improved for that portion of said lot or lots within 300 feet of the ultimate property line of said highway so as to meet the standards for local streets provided in Subsection H of this section and provide adequate right-turn ingress to and egress from the highway; or such dedication and improvement has been assured to the satisfaction of the City Engineer respectively. As used in this section, the center of the highway or collector street shall mean the center of those highways or collector streets as are shown on the Highways and Freeways maps of the Transportation Element of the General Plan or, with respect to collector streets, on the adopted community plans of the Land Use Element of the General Plan on file in the offices of the Department of City Planning.\u00a0 (Second Sentence Amended by Ord. No. 172,840, Eff. 11\/4\/99.)\n\n\t1.\tThe maximum area of land required to be so dedicated shall not exceed 25% of the area of any such lot which was of record on March 1, 1962 in the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s Office. In no event\u00a0 shall such dedication reduce the lot below a width of 50 feet or an area of 5,000 square feet.\n\n\t2.\tNo such dedication for any highway, collector street or any other street shall be required with respect to those portions of such a lot occupied by a legally existing main building which is to remain.\n\n\t3.\tNo additional improvement shall be required on such a lot where complete roadway, curb, gutter and sidewalk improvements exist\u00a0 within the present dedication contiguous thereto.\n\n\t4.\tNo building or structure shall be erected on any such lot after March 1, 1962 within the dedication required by Subsection H of this section.\n\n\t5.\t(Added by Ord. No. 173,217, Eff. 6\/11\/00.)\u00a0 No such dedication for any highway, collector street, or any street shall be required when the City Engineer, based on guidelines established by the Streets Standards Committee, finds that any additional dedication is not necessary to meet the mobility needs for the next twenty years.\n\n\tThe guidelines developed by Streets Standards Committees shall be consistent with the goals and purpose of the Transportation Element of the General Plan as determined by the City Planning Commission.\u00a0 These guidelines shall also establish a procedure for notice to interested persons, including the Councilmember of the district where the property is located.\n\n\tB.\tExceptions.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

The trustee under a deed of trust shall not be required to execute the dedicatory instrument, unless, in the view of the City Engineer, such execution is necessary to satisfactorily dedicate the land. Such report shall be furnished by the applicant. Such offer shall be on a form approved by the City Attorney and the City Engineer; be in such terms as to be binding on the owner, his heirs, assigns or successors in interest and shall continue until the City Council accepts or rejects such offer or until one year from the date such offer is filed with the City Engineer for processing, whichever occurs first. The offer shall provide that the dedication will be complete upon acceptance by the City Council. The offer shall be recorded by the City Engineer in the Office of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County upon its acceptance by the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall accept or reject the offer for recordation within 10 days after it is filed with the City Engineer. The offer shall thereafter be promptly processed by the City Departments concerned and submitted to the City Council, in order to complete the dedication within one year. If the offer is rejected by the City Council or not processed within one year, the City Engineer shall issue a release from such offer which shall be recorded in the Office of the County Recorder unless the parties making the offer wish to have the time extended. (Amended by Ord. No. 152,425, Eff. 6\/29\/79, Oper. 7\/1\/79.)\n\n\tD.\tImprovement Procedure.\n\n\t1.\tAny person required to make improvements by the provisions of this section shall either make and complete the same to the satisfaction of the City Engineer or shall file with the City Engineer a bond in such an amount as the City Engineer shall estimate and determine to be necessary to complete all of the improvements required.\n\n\t2.\tSuch bond may be either a cash bond or a bond executed by a company authorized to act as a surety in this State. The bond shall be payable to the City and be conditioned upon the faithful performance of any and all work required to be done, and that should such work not be done or completed within the time specified, the City may at its option, cause the same to be done or completed, and the parties executing the bond shall be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for the payment of all necessary costs and expenses incurred in the construction thereof. The bond shall be executed by the owner of the lot as principal, and if a surety bond, shall also be executed by a corporation authorized to act as a surety under the laws of the State of California.\n\n\t3.\tWhenever the owner elects to deposit a cash bond, the City is authorized, in the event of any default on his part, to use any or all of the deposit money to cause all of the required work to be done or completed, and for payment of all costs and expenses therefor. Any money remaining shall be refunded to the owner.\n\n\t4.\tWhen a substantial portion of the required improvement has been completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and the completion of the remaining improvements is delayed due to conditions beyond the owner\u2019s control, the City Engineer may accept the completed portion and consent to a proportionate reduction of the surety bond in an amount estimated and determined by the City Engineer to be adequate to assure the completion of the required improvements remaining to be made.\n\n\t5.\tWhenever a surety bond has been filed in compliance with this section, the City is authorized, in the event of any default on the part of the principal, to enforce collection, under such bond, for any and all damages sustained by the City by reason of any failure on the part of the principal faithfully and properly to do or complete the required improvements, and in addition may cause all of the required work to be done or completed, and the surety upon the bond shall be firmly bound for the payment of all necessary costs thereof.\n\n\t6.\tThe term of the bond shall begin on the date of the deposit of cash or the filing of the surety bond, and shall end upon the date of the completion to the satisfaction of the City Engineer of all improvements required to be made. The fact of such completion shall be endorsed by a statement thereof signed by the City Engineer, and the deposit shall be returned to the owner, or the surety bond may be exonerated at any time thereafter.\n\n\t7.\tFor purposes of this section, improvement shall be considered as satisfactorily assured when the City Engineer accepts the cash or surety bond provided for herein or the improvements required to be made have been completed to his satisfaction. When the City Engineer accepts the bond or the work has been completed to his satisfaction he shall notify the Department of Building and Safety thereof.\n\n\tE.\tIssuance Of Building Permits After Certification Of Dedication And Improvement. When all dedication and improvements required by this section have been completed or satisfactorily assured a building permit may be issued.\n\n\tF.\tFees.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9\/28\/12.)\u00a0 In addition to all other required fees, the following fees shall be charged for Bureau of Engineering services provided for processing building permit applications pursuant to the provisions of this Section:\n\n\t1.\tA nonrefundable fee of $530 for every property requiring the City Engineer to investigate and determine whether the provisions of this Section require a dedication of land or improvements to land.\n\n\t2.\tA fee of $3,100 for processing real estate transfer documents for every property for which the provisions of this Section require a dedication of land.\n\n\t3.\tA nonrefundable fee of $250 for processing appeals of dedication requirements pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 5. of Subsection A. of this Section.\n\n\t4.\tA nonrefundable fee of $1,000 for processing appeals of improvement requirements pursuant to the provisions of Subsection I. of this Section.\n\n\tG.\tLots Affected By Street Widening.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 125,340, Eff. 9\/23\/63.) On a lot which is affected by street widening required by the provisions of this section all required yards, setbacks, parking area, loading space and building locations for new buildings or structures or additions to buildings or structures shall be measured and calculated from the new lot lines being created by said widening; provided, however, that for the purpose of establishing the required front yard depth on a frontage where the ultimate street line has been determined under the provisions of this section, the depths of all existing front yards may be measured from such ultimate street line instead of the front lot line.\n\n\tIn applying all other provisions of this Article, the area of such lot shall be considered as that which existed immediately prior to such required street widening.\n\n\tH.\tImprovement Standards.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 150,799, Eff. 6\/5\/78.)\n\n\t1.\t(Amended by Ord. No. 173,217, Eff. 6\/11\/00.)\u00a0 All major and secondary highways and all collector streets shall be constructed and improved in accordance with the standards adopted by the City Planning Commission pursuant to LAMC 17.05 B. insofar as such is practical and will not create an undue hardship.\n\n\tWhere major or secondary highways are designated by the General Plan as divided highways, the width of the dividing strips shall not be considered a part of the highway for the purpose of calculating either the width of the dedication or the width of the improvement required by this section.\n\n\t2.\t(Amended by Ord. No. 173,217, Eff. 6\/11\/00.)\u00a0 All streets not designated major or secondary highways or collector streets, but that intersect said highways, shall be dedicated to a maximum width of sixty (60) feet.\u00a0 Roadway and parkway widths shall conform to those standards adopted by the City Planning Commission in accordance with LAMC 17.05 B., depending upon street classification type.\u00a0 Whenever uncertainty exists as to the application of the provisions of this section, or in instances of streets so classified as requiring less than 60 feet of dedication in order to conform to the minimum width standards as adopted in accordance with Section 17.05 B. of this Code, the City Engineer shall make any necessary determinations.\n\n\t3.\tAll improvements required to be made by the provisions of this subsection shall be done in accordance with the current applicable provisions of the Standard specifications for Public Works Construction adopted by the City Council.\n\n\t4.\tThe City Engineer may approve and allow such variations from the aforesaid requirements as he determines are made necessary by the conditions of the terrain and the existing improvements contiguous to the property involved.\n\n\tI.\tAppeal.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 153,949, Eff. 7\/19\/80.)\n\n\t1.\tAny person required to make improvements pursuant to the provisions of this Section may appeal to the City Council any City Engineer decision made with respect to the enforcement or administration of the provisions of this Section.\u00a0 Such appeal shall be made in writing, shall state in clear and concise language the grounds for the appeal, and the appellant must pay a filing fee in the amount specified in Subdivision (d) of Subsection F. of this Section to pay for City costs to process the appeal.\u00a0 The Board of Public Works, with the concurrence of the City Administrative Officer, shall regularly determine the costs to the City to process such appeal, and shall include all direct and indirect costs, including but not limited to inspection costs, and labor, retirement and overhead costs.\u00a0 The Board of Public Works shall use these costs to identify a fee amount sufficient to recover City costs for processing an appeal, and shall recommend to the City Council adoption of an ordinance establishing a new appeal fee amount.\u00a0 Such fee shall become effective on the effective date of the ordinance.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,699, Eff. 6\/12\/11.)\n\n\t2.\tThe City Council may make such modifications in the improvement requirements of this section or may grant such waivers or modifications of the determinations which are appealed to it as it shall determine are required to prevent any unreasonable hardship under the facts of each case so long as each such modification or waiver is in conformity with the general spirit and intent of the requirements of this section.\n\n\tJ.\tCity May Share The Cost Of Making Unusual Improvements. Upon proper application to the City Council and upon recommendation of the City Engineer, the City may accept and provide for contribution toward the cost of making any improvement required by the provisions of this section which the City Engineer determines will cost an amount greatly in excess of the cost to other property owners who are required to make improvements under the provisions of this section in the immediate vicinity of the said improvement.\n\n\tK.\tCity Engineer To Determine Street Alignment. Whenever uncertainty exists as to the proper application of the provisions of this section in the matter of street alignment, the City Engineer shall determine their application in conformity with the spirit and intent of this section.
