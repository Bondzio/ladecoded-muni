  EXPLOSION RELIEF VENTING.	A.	Explosion relief vents shall be provided on all
duct systems used for conveying materials which form an explosive mixture with
air.  Explosion vents shall have a cross sectional area not less than the cross
sectional area of the duct vented.  Vents should be provided where direction of
flow is changed and at the maximum elevation in the system.	B.	Explosion relief
vents for ducts shall lead by the most direct practical route to the outside of
the building and shall not deviate more than 22-1/2 degrees from the direction
of the duct from which they lead.  Such vents shall not pass through adjoining
buildings unless designed to resist maximum explosion pressure.	C.	Storage bins
or other receptacles which contain materials which form an explosive mixture
with air shall be provided with adequate explosion relief vents.	D.	Explosion
relief vent openings shall be provided with diaphragms fitted with cutters to
accelerate rupture or equivalent means of relieving pressure.  Where necessary,
the discharge opening of the relief vent may be protected against the weather in
an approved manner.	E.	Explosion relief vent openings shall not be connected to
chimneys or duct systems used for other purposes.
