	The duty to collect and remit the taxes imposed by this article shall be performed as set forth in this section.

	(b)	The duty to collect tax from a Service User shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to that Person, which starts on or after the operative date of this article.&#xA0; When the rate of the tax is increased or decreased, the duty to collect at the new rate shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing periods applicable to that Person, which starts on or after the effective date of the new rate.&#xA0; Where a Person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.
