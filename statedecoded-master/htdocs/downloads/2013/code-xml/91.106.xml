	If the work described by a valid permit is prohibited by a change in the Los Angeles Municipal Code, then such work may be completed only if the department determines that both substantial liabilities have been incurred, and substantial work has been performed on site, in accordance with the terms of that permit. Work performed and liabilities incurred pursuant to a demolition or relocation permit shall not be considered in determining whether an owner may complete a building or structure for which a building permit has been issued.

91.106.4.3.2.&#xA0; Validity of Other Laws. Neither the issuance of a permit nor the approval by the department of any document shall constitute an approval of any violation of any provision of this Code or of any other law or ordinance, and a permit or other document purporting to give authority to violate any law shall not be valid with respect thereto.

91.106.4.3.3.&#xA0; Official Grades.&#xA0; The applicant shall satisfy himself as to the correctness of proposed structure elevations and locations with respect to the official grades of public streets and to the policy of the Board of Public Works relative to the location and length of curb depressions for driveways.

91.106.4.3.4.&#xA0; Easements.&#xA0; Before issuing any permit, the department shall require a declaration, under penalty of perjury, from the owner or agent having the property owner&#x2019;s consent stating that:

	&#x201C;The proposed work will not destroy or unreasonably interfere with any access or utility easement belonging to others and located on my property, but in the event such work does destroy or unreasonably interfere with such easement, a substitute easement(s) satisfactory to the holder(s) of the easement will be provided.&#x201D;

91.106.4.4.&#xA0; Expiration, Suspension or Revocation.

91.106.4.4.1.&#xA0; General.&#xA0; The regulations concerning the expiration, suspension and revocation of permits are enumerated in Chapter IX Article 8, Division 6, of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.

91.106.4.4.2.&#xA0; Making False Statements to the Department.&#xA0; Any person who willfully or knowingly, with the intent to deceive, makes a false statement or representation, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact in any documentation required by the department to ascertain facts relative to this section, to the exception in Section 91.107.2.9 or to Section 91.112 of this Code, including any oral or written evidence presented, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

91.106.4.4.3.&#xA0; Unfinished Buildings or Structures. Whenever the department determines by inspection that work on any building or structure for which a permit has been issued and the work started thereon has been suspended for a period of 180 days or more, the owner of the property upon which such structure is located, or other person or agent in control of said property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the department to do so, shall, within 90 days from the date of such written notice, obtain a new permit to complete the required work and diligently pursue the work to completion, or shall remove or demolish the building or structure within 180 days from the date of the written notice.

91.106.4.5.&#xA0; Permits for Historical and Cultural Buildings.&#xA0; The department shall not issue a permit to demolish, alter or remove a building or structure of historical, archaeological or architectural consequence if such building or structure has been officially designated, or has been determined by state or federal action to be eligible for designation, on the National Register of Historic Places, or has been included on the City of Los Angeles list of historic cultural monuments, without the department having first determined whether the demolition, alteration or removal may result in the loss of or serious damage to a significant historical or cultural asset.&#xA0; If the department determines that such loss or damage may occur, the applicant shall file an application and pay all fees for the California Environmental Quality Act Initial Study and Check List, as specified in Section 19.05 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. If the Initial Study and Check List identifies the historical or cultural asset as significant, the permit shall not be issued without the department first finding that specific economic, social or other considerations make infeasible the preservation of the building or structure.

91.106.4.6.&#xA0; Notification and Posting in a Hillside Grading Area.

91.106.4.6.1.&#xA0; In any area designated as a hillside grading area, the department shall not issue (1) a building permit for construction of a building with over 500 square feet of floor area, or (2) a building permit for any addition to an existing building which adds over 500 square feet of floor area, or (3) a grading permit for the grading of more than 1,000 cubic yards of earth materials without having first done the following at least 10 days prior to issuance of the building or grading permit:

	1.	The department shall send written notices of the permit application, by mail, to the owners of all property abutting the property at which the construction or grading will occur. Notices shall also be sent to the owners of all property across the street or alley when such property is intersected by a projection of the lot lines of the property at which the construction or grading will occur; and

	2.	The department shall post a notice of the permit application on the property at which the construction or grading will occur.

91.106.4.6.2.&#xA0; The applicant seeking the permit shall provide the department with the names and addresses of all persons entitled to receive notice pursuant to Section 91.106.4.6.1.

91.106.4.6.3.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 171,185, Eff. 7/22/96.)&#xA0; The Department shall collect a fee in the amount of $60.00 when an application for a building or grading permit described in Section 91.106.4.6.1 above is filed with the Department.

91.106.4.7.&#xA0; Curb Ramps.

91.106.4.7.1.&#xA0; Condition of Permits. Subject to the provisions of Section 91.106.4.7.2, no building or structure shall be erected or enlarged, and no building permit issued therefor, on any lot, any part of which is within 100 feet of the straight projection of the intersection of the building lines of a corner lot of the block within which subject lot fronts, unless the applicant agrees in writing, and submits the necessary surety in the form of a bond or cash deposit, to construct a corner curb ramp at such corner and in addition, if such lot is within 100 feet of two such intersections to construct corner curb ramps at each of the two adjacent corners at both intersections, for a total of two ramps. The curb ramp shall comply with the standards contained in Part 2 of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Such improvements procedure shall, in all respects, be in compliance with Section 12.37D of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.

	2.	A building or structure or addition thereto of less than 500 square feet in gross floor area or when such building, structure or addition thereto contains a restaurant or fast food restaurant of less than 200 square feet in gross floor area.

	3.	Where sidewalks are neither currently installed nor required by the city as a condition of development, at either the location of the proposed development or the location of the otherwise proposed curb ramp.

91.106.4.7.2.&#xA0; It is hereby determined that the requirements of Section 91.106.4.7.1 hereof shall be imposed as a condition to the erection of any structure or addition thereto wherein handicapped access is otherwise required.

cleaning, steam cleaning of buildings outside of Fire District No. 1 and also
those exterior surfaces of buildings which are located more than 20 feet from
pedestrian walkways in dedicated streets.&#xA0; Painting, papering and similar work,
provided, however, that the values thereof shall be included as part of the

11/1/02.)&#xA0; The department shall have the authority to withhold a permit for any
building if public sewers are not available and the provisions of Article 4,
Chapter IX of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (Plumbing Code) prohibit the use of
a private sewage disposal system on the lot or premises.	Notwithstanding the
provisions of Chapter 7 of the California Plumbing Code as adopted in Section
94.700.0 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code to the contrary, and for any lot or
premises located in whole or in part in the San Fernando Valley and certain
adjacent areas as described in Section 64.26 A.2. of the Los Angeles Municipal
Code:	If public sewers are not available and Article 4 of Chapter IX of this
Code does not prohibit the use of a private sewage disposal system, a building
permit may be issued, provided that:	A.	The owner or owners shall install a
holding tank pursuant to permits from the Department of Building and Safety and
the Fire Department; and	B.	The owner or owners shall submit a covenant and
agreement that runs with the land to provide a connection to the public sewer

The Department shall have the authority to withhold permits where the proposed
development is located in an area subject to slides or unstable soil which may
have an adverse effect on the proposed development or access thereto, as
determined by the Department.&#xA0; If the apparent safety of the proposed
development can be verified pursuant to the provisions of Sections 91.7016.4.2
and 91.7016.4.3 of this Code, the Department shall issue a permit upon receipt
of a sworn affidavit which has been recorded by the County Recorder, stating
that the applicant is fully aware that the proposed development is located in an
area subject to slides or unstable soil which may have an adverse effect on the
proposed development or access thereto.	3.	The department shall have the
authority to withhold a building permit where the proposed building site is an
area subject to inundation, as determined by the department. If it can be shown
by authentic past records that any possible inundation is not likely to be of
such extent as to be an immediate hazard to occupancy of the proposed building,
the department shall issue a building permit upon receipt of a sworn affidavit
which has been recorded by the county recorder stating that said applicant is
fully aware of the department&#x2019;s finding that the structure is an area subject
to inundation.	4.	The department shall have the authority to withhold permits on
projects located within a Special (Fault) Studies Zone established under Chapter
7.5, Division 2, of the California Public Resources Code. Permits may be issued
if it can be demonstrated through accepted geologic seismic studies that the
proposed structure will be located in a safe manner and not over or astraddle
the trace of an active fault.&#xA0; Acceptable geologic seismic studies shall meet
the criteria as set forth in rules and regulations established by the
Superintendent of Building to assure that such studies are based on sufficient
geologic data to determine the location or nonexistence of the active fault
trace on a site. Prior to approval of a project, a geologic report defining and
delineating any hazard of surface fault rupture shall be required. If the city
finds that no undue hazard of this kind exists, the geologic report on such
hazard may be waived, with approval of the state geologist.	5.	(Amended by Ord.
No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)&#xA0; The department shall have the authority to withhold
a demolition or relocation permit for a residential building composed of two or
more residential rental units under the following circumstances:	A.	When the
applicant states that the purpose for demolition or relocation is to construct a
condominium, stock cooperative or community apartment project, permits shall be
withheld until all necessary tentative tract or preliminary parcel maps for such
new subdivision have been approved by the city.	B.	This Exception 5 shall not
apply if the building is to be demolished and is:	(i)	Constructed of
unreinforced masonry construction and built pursuant to a building permit issued
prior to October l, 1933, or	(ii)	To be demolished pursuant to a demolition
order issued by the department under authority set forth in Division 89 of
Article l of Chapter IX of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.	C.	This Exception 5
shall not apply if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
department that the site will be developed with housing for low to moderate
income households, which housing is to be developed, constructed or acquired
with federal, state or local government financial assistance.	D.	This Exception
5 shall not apply to two family dwellings or to apartment houses and apartment
hotels containing three dwelling units, provided that at least one dwelling unit
in each such building is occupied by a record owner of the property.	6.	(Amended
by Ord. No. 175,790, Eff. 3/29/04.)&#xA0; The Department shall have the authority to
withhold permits on projects located within a Methane Zone or Methane Buffer
Zone established under Sections 91.7101 et seq. of this Code.&#xA0; Permits may be
issued upon submittal of detailed plans that show adequate protection against
flammable gas incursion by providing the installation of suitable methane
mitigation systems.	7.	The department shall have the authority to withhold
permits for public works capital improvement projects until receipt of written
certification from the Cultural Affairs Department that the board, bureau or
department of the city authorized by law to construct the project has fully
complied with the requirements of the city&#x2019;s Public Works Improvements Arts
Program. For purposes of this section, public works capital improvement
project&#x201D; includes any capital project paid for wholly or in part by the City
of Los Angeles or by any board, bureau or department of the city authorized by
the City Charter or other law to construct or remodel any building, structure,
park, utility, street, sidewalk or parking facility, or any other type of
capital project or any portion thereof, within the geographical limits of the

signed the plans, specifications, reports, or documents was not also a proximate
cause of the damage.	Grading plans which are on file with the Department are

Authorization.&#xA0; The issuance of a permit is not an approval or an authorization
of the work specified therein. A permit is merely an application for inspection,
the issuance of which entitles the permittee to inspection of the work which is
described therein.	Permits issued under the requirements of this Code shall not
relieve the owner of responsibility for securing required permits for work to be
done which is regulated by any other Code, department or division of the City of
Los Angeles.	All permits are issued subject to the following conditions:	If the
work described by a valid permit is prohibited by a change in the Los Angeles
Municipal Code, then such work may be completed only if the department
determines that both substantial liabilities have been incurred, and substantial
work has been performed on site, in accordance with the terms of that permit.
Work performed and liabilities incurred pursuant to a demolition or relocation
permit shall not be considered in determining whether an owner may complete a
building or structure for which a building permit has been
issued.91.106.4.3.2.&#xA0; Validity of Other Laws. Neither the issuance of a permit
nor the approval by the department of any document shall constitute an approval
of any violation of any provision of this Code or of any other law or ordinance,
and a permit or other document purporting to give authority to violate any law
shall not be valid with respect thereto.91.106.4.3.3.&#xA0; Official Grades.&#xA0; The

elevations and locations with respect to the official grades of public streets
and to the policy of the Board of Public Works relative to the location and
length of curb depressions for driveways.91.106.4.3.4.&#xA0; Easements.&#xA0; Before
issuing any permit, the department shall require a declaration, under penalty of
perjury, from the owner or agent having the property owner&#x2019;s consent stating
that:	&#x201C;The proposed work will not destroy or unreasonably interfere with any
access or utility easement belonging to others and located on my property, but
in the event such work does destroy or unreasonably interfere with such
easement, a substitute easement(s) satisfactory to the holder(s) of the easement
will be provided.&#x201D;91.106.4.4.&#xA0; Expiration, Suspension or
Revocation.91.106.4.4.1.&#xA0; General.&#xA0; The regulations concerning the expiration,
suspension and revocation of permits are enumerated in Chapter IX Article 8,
Division 6, of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.91.106.4.4.2.&#xA0; Making False
Statements to the Department.&#xA0; Any person who willfully or knowingly, with the
intent to deceive, makes a false statement or representation, or knowingly fails
to disclose a material fact in any documentation required by the department to
ascertain facts relative to this section, to the exception in Section 91.107.2.9
or to Section 91.112 of this Code, including any oral or written evidence
presented, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.91.106.4.4.3.&#xA0; Unfinished Buildings
or Structures. Whenever the department determines by inspection that work on any
building or structure for which a permit has been issued and the work started
thereon has been suspended for a period of 180 days or more, the owner of the
property upon which such structure is located, or other person or agent in
control of said property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the department
to do so, shall, within 90 days from the date of such written notice, obtain a
new permit to complete the required work and diligently pursue the work to
completion, or shall remove or demolish the building or structure within 180
days from the date of the written notice.91.106.4.5.&#xA0; Permits for Historical
and Cultural Buildings.&#xA0; The department shall not issue a permit to demolish,
alter or remove a building or structure of historical, archaeological or
architectural consequence if such building or structure has been officially
designated, or has been determined by state or federal action to be eligible for
designation, on the National Register of Historic Places, or has been included
on the City of Los Angeles list of historic cultural monuments, without the
department having first determined whether the demolition, alteration or removal
may result in the loss of or serious damage to a significant historical or
cultural asset.&#xA0; If the department determines that such loss or damage may
occur, the applicant shall file an application and pay all fees for the
California Environmental Quality Act Initial Study and Check List, as specified
in Section 19.05 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. If the Initial Study and
Check List identifies the historical or cultural asset as significant, the
permit shall not be issued without the department first finding that specific
economic, social or other considerations make infeasible the preservation of the
building or structure.91.106.4.6.&#xA0; Notification and Posting in a Hillside
