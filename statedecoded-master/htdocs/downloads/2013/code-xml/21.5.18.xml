purpose of administering and enforcing this article, and prescribing methods for

practicable to the sales tax reimbursement schedule provided in Subsection (b)
of Section 21.199. Such schedules may be so determined as to facilitate
collection of this tax at the same time as the retailer collects the tax imposed
under the California Sales and Use Tax Law.	Such rules and regulations may,
among other things, require each person affected by this article to keep such
records, receipts, invoices and other pertinent papers as the Director of
Finance may deem necessary for the purposes of administering and enforcing this
article. (Amended by Ord. No. 137,130, Oper. 10/1/68.)	(b)	Inasmuch as this

regulation in so far as applicable, shall apply in the interpretation of this
article until specifically abandoned by rules and regulations adopted by the
Director of Finance pursuant to the authority of this article.
