as specifically provided hereinafter; provided however, that any device covered
by this Code, found to be in a dangerous condition, or if the design or method
of operation in combination with devices used is considered inherently
dangerous, or if there is an immediate hazard to those riding on or using such
equipment, it shall be the duty of the Department to notify the holder of the
