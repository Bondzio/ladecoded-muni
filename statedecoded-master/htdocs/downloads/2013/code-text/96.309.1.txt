INFORMATION FURNISHED AS GROUND FOR RESCISSION. (§ 96.309.1)

  INFORMATION FURNISHED AS GROUND FOR RESCISSION.	Any contract for the sale or
exchange of residential property subject to the provisions of this division,
including escrow contracts, shall not be invalidated as a result of the
information furnished in said report unless it reveals a material
misrepresentation or concealment by the owner or unless it reveals a material
mistake by both owner and prospective buyer or transferee which would justify a
rescission of the sale or exchange in the absence of this division.  Should
such report reveal such misrepresentation, concealment, or mistake, the sale or
exchange may be rescinded or cancelled at the option of the buyer or transferee.
