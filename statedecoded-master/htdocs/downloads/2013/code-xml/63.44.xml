organizations qualified as nonprofit organizations under State and federal tax
laws pursuant to written permit from the Board, from posting and maintaining
signs at sport fields where such organizations conduct a sport recreation
program or programs acknowledging the sponsorship of such organizations by
firms, businesses, or individuals; provided that as to any location where the
Board authorizes such signs to be posted the following conditions are
met:	(1)	The sole or primary purpose of the nonprofit sport organization is to
conduct a sport recreation program or programs at the sport field
involved.	(2)	The nonprofit sport organization is required to maintain the sport
field involved at its own cost and expense.	(3)	Such signs are posted only
during the playing season for that particular sport each year and only for the
shorter of either the duration of the season or the period of time that the
non-profit sport organization operates that season&#x2019;s program at that facility,
and not at any other time.	(4)	The proceeds derived from the sponsorships
acknowledged by such signs are expended solely for the maintenance of the sport
field involved; except that any surplus after meeting such expenses may be
expended to meet the expenses incurred by the non-profit organization in
conducting the recreation program or programs at that facility.	(5)	The signs
are placed only on the perimeter fence of the field, are one-sided, facing the
spectator area of the field, and are of a size, number and design as specified
by the Board.	(6)	Each such sign identifies the sponsor as well as the
non-profit organization and contains a statement declaring such sponsorship or
support.	(b)	Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the County
of Los Angeles from conducting a Marketing Program on those beaches which are
the subject of that certain &#x201C;Joint Powers Agreement Between the City of Los
Angeles and the County of Los Angeles Providing for Lifeguard and Maintenance
Services to be Rendered by the County on Beaches Located Within the City&#x201D;
dated May 20, 1975, as amended. The term &#x201C;Marketing Program&#x201D; is defined to
mean a program whereby the County grants third parties limited advertising
rights on the beaches, such as the right to display name or product
identification on lifeguard towers, trucks, uniforms, rescue boats, lifeguard
equipment, public restrooms, fences, concession buildings, parking lot receipts
and other beach facilities, in exchange for financial support in the form of
money, equipment or services to be used in performing the obligations assumed by
the County in the Agreement. Provided, however, that any such name and product
identification shall not directly solicit the sale, use or consumption of any
product; that the County shall not permit name and product identification of
alcoholic beverage or tobacco products; and that the County shall not display
the name of any marketing program sponsor or donor, or of their products on the
beaches in any manner other than as is described in this subsection without the
prior written approval from the Board. Additionally, such Marketing Program
shall be subject to all of the restrictions set forth in Section 2.116.210 of
the Administrative Code of the County of Los Angeles, which is incorporated
herein by reference as amended from time-to-time.	24.	(Added by Ord. No.
179,058, Eff. 9/18/07.)&#xA0; No person, except as provided here, shall light,

of the point of display of said blackball flag, provided, however, that where
said blackball flag is displayed from consecutive operational lifeguard towers,

Ocean opposite said beach shall be restricted to swimming and bathing only.	Such
restrictions shall also be indicated by pairs of red flags put in place by the
