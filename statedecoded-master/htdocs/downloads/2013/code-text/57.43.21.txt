INSTALLATION OF SPECIAL VESSELS. (§ 57.43.21)

  INSTALLATION OF SPECIAL VESSELS.	A.	Special vessels shall be provided with
substantial concrete or masonry foundations, or structural-steel supports on
firm concrete, or masonry foundations. Structural-steel supports for special
vessels of flammable materials shall be protected with a fire-protective
coating, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 9 of the L.A.M.C.
(Building Code).	B.	Horizontal special vessels shall be so mounted on
foundations as to permit expansion and contraction.  Every special vessel shall
be supported to prevent the concentration of excessive Ioads on the supporting
portion of the shell. That portion of the special vessel in contact with
foundations or saddles shall be protected against corrosion.	C.	Secure anchorage
or adequate pier height shall be provided to insure against stationary special
vessel flotation wherever sufficiently high flood water might
occur.	D.	Provisions shall be made to prevent the freezing of the soil beneath
special vessels resting on the ground if the operating temperature of the
special vessel is below 32° F.
