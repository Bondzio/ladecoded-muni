entirely on the side of the bisecting line closest to that street and the sign face is placed at the same angle as the perpendicular line or at an angle not to exceed 20 degrees from either side of the perpendicular line as shown on Diagram C of this article.\n\n\t2.\tAn off-site sign located on a through lot shall be located on a single street if the sign and its support structure are located entirely on that half of the lot closest to the lot line adjoining that street.\n\n\tAny off-site sign not in conformance with either Subdivision 1. or 2. above shall be considered to be located on more than one street frontage.\n\n\tE.\tSpacing.\n\n\t1.\tAn off-site sign, which is either single-faced or parallel double-faced, shall be spaced as specified in Table No. B of this article from any other existing or previously permitted off-site sign, which is single-faced or parallel double-faced.\n\n\t2.\tFor any double-faced off-site sign, the spacing requirements shall be based on the area of the largest sign face.\n\n\t3.\tFor double-faced off-site signs whose faces are not parallel, the spacing between any proposed, permitted or existing off-site sign shall be determined by the following formula:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n      \n        =\n      \n      \n        S\n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        1+\n      \n      \n        (B \u2013 5)\n

feet.\n\nB=\twidest edge separation of sign faces in feet.\n\n\t4.\tSpacing shall be measured between off-site signs that are located on the same side of the same street.\u00a0 Spacing shall be measured from a line that is perpendicular to the building line and that passes through a point on the building line that is closest to the nearest sign face edge.\u00a0 Spacing shall be measured along the center line of the street.\n\n\tF.\tDouble-faced \n\n\t1.\tOff-site signs may be either single or double-faced.\n\n\t2.\tFor double-faced off-site signs whose faces are parallel, the distance between sign faces shall not exceed six feet.\u00a0\n\n\t3.\tFor double-faced off-site signs whose faces are not parallel, the distance between sign faces at their widest point shall not exceed 35 feet.\u00a0 The separation of sign faces at their closest point shall not exceed six feet.\u00a0 In no event shall the angle between sign faces exceed 37 degrees.\n\n\tG.\tProjection.\u00a0 Off-site signs shall not project beyond the building line.\n\n\tH.\tCovering.\u00a0 The backs of off-site signs exposed to public view shall be covered with a finished surface or material and shall be properly maintained.\n\n\tI.\tOther Requirements.\n\n\t1.\tA maximum of two poles shall be permitted for any off-site sign.\u00a0 The maximum cross-sectional dimension of a pole shall not exceed ten percent of the overall height of the sign.\n\n\t2.\tOff-site sign supports shall be structurally independent of a building. \u00a0\n\n\t3.\tSign support structures must be located directly under the

closest to the nearest sign face edge.\u00a0 Spacing shall be measured along the center line of the street.\tF.\tDouble-faced \t1.\tOff-site signs may be either single or double-faced.\t2.\tFor double-faced off-site signs whose faces are parallel, the distance between sign faces shall not exceed six feet.\u00a0\t3.\tFor double-faced off-site signs whose faces are not parallel, the distance between sign faces at their widest point shall not exceed 35 feet.\u00a0 The separation of sign faces at their closest point shall not exceed six feet.\u00a0 In no event shall the angle between sign faces exceed 37 degrees.\tG.\tProjection.\u00a0 Off-site signs shall not project beyond the building line.\tH.\tCovering.\u00a0 The backs of off-site signs exposed to public view shall be covered with a finished surface or material and shall be properly maintained.\tI.\tOther Requirements.\t1.\tA maximum of two poles shall be permitted for any off-site sign.\u00a0 The maximum cross-sectional dimension of a pole shall not exceed ten percent of the overall height of the sign.\t2.\tOff-site sign supports shall be structurally independent of a building. \u00a0\t3.\tSign support structures must be located directly under the sign face as viewed from the front of the sign.\u00a0 The maximum horizontal distance between the center of the sign support structure and the sign face shall not exceed ten feet.","type":"section","prefixes":[""],"prefix":"","entire_prefix":"","prefix_anchor":"","level":1}}}
