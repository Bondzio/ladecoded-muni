  NEW LOCKS IN APARTMENTS – INSTALLATION REQUIRED.
	(Added by Ord. No. 151,381, Eff. 10/6/78.)	As used herein the terms “dwelling
unit” and “apartment hotel” shall be defined as those terms are defined in
Section 12.03 of this Code.	Any person managing controlling, leasing or renting
any previously occupied dwelling unit, other than a dwelling unit in an
apartment hotel which is customarily occupied for a period of 15 days or less,
shall, at the time any lease or rental of such dwelling unit is entered into,
notify the lessee that any lock on the leased or rented premises will be changed
upon written request therefor. If requested, such lock change shall be
accomplished within 15 days after the date of such request by either installing
a new lock, installing another key cylinder or by altering the pins of the
existing lock so that such lock can be opened only with a new key. A violation
of any of the provisions of this section shall be punishable as an infraction.
