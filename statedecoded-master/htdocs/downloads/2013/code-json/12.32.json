No. 173,992, Eff. 7\/6\/01.)\u00a0 The Council may approve or disapprove an application or initiated proposed land use ordinance.\u00a0 It shall approve an ordinance only after making findings that its action is consistent with the General Plan and is in conformity with public necessity, convenience, general welfare and good zoning practice.\u00a0 If the Planning Commission recommends approval of an application, then the Council shall act within 90 days of receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation.\u00a0 The 90 day time limit to act on a Planning Commission approval of an application may be extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the Council.\n\n\tD.\tAppeal.\n\n\t1.\tFiling of an Appeal.\u00a0 If the Planning Commission recommends disapproval of an application, in whole or in part, the applicant may appeal that decision to the Council by filing an appeal with the Planning Commission that made the initial decision.\u00a0 If no appeal is filed, a denial is final.\u00a0 An appeal shall be filed within 20 days of the date of the mailing of the Planning Commission\u2019s decision, on a form provided by the Department, and shall set forth specifically the reasons for the appeal.\u00a0 Any appeal not filed within the 20-day period shall not be considered by the Council.\u00a0 Once an appeal is filed, the Planning Commission shall transmit the appeal and its file to the City Clerk.\u00a0 At any time prior to the action of the Council on the appeal, the Department shall submit any supplementary, pertinent information as the Council or its Committee may request.\n\n\t2.\tAppellate Decision \u2013 Public Hearing and Notice.\u00a0 Before the Council acts on the appeal, it shall hold a public hearing.\u00a0 The City Clerk shall set the matter for hearing, giving notice by mail of the time, place and purpose of the hearing to the applicant and to any interested party who has requested in writing to be so notified.\u00a0 The notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing.\n\n\t3.\tTime for Appellate Decision.\u00a0 The Council shall make its decision within 75 days after the expiration of the appeal period.\u00a0 The 75 day time limit to act on an appeal may be extended by mutual written consent of the applicant and the Council.\u00a0 If the Council fails to act within this time limit, the failure shall constitute a denial of the application or disapproval of the initiated land use ordinance.\n\n\tE.\tAmendment to the Zoning Regulations.\u00a0 The procedures for initiation and decision-making for amendments to Chapter 1 of this Code and other zoning regulations shall be the same as provided for City Planning Commission and Council initiated zone changes as set forth above, except that the City Planning Commission shall be the designated Planning Commission for these actions and proceedings for the amendment of the regulations need not comply with the notice requirements in Subsection C 4, nor be set for public hearing.\n\n\tF.\tZone Changes and Height District Changes.\u00a0 The procedures for changes of zoning or height districts shall be as set forth in Subsections A through D, with the following additional regulations:\n\n\t1.\tIn the consideration of an application for a proposed land use ordinance involving a change of zone, the Planning Commission may approve or disapprove a change upon all or only a part of the subject area.\u00a0 The Planning Commission may recommend a change to any zone between that existing on the property and that requested in the application, as determined by the Planning Commission, or may recommend, on all or a portion of the property, a change to a P or PB Zone, or may recommend that an M Zone be changed to an MR Zone.\u00a0 The Planning Commission may, without additional notice or hearing, recommend minor additions to the area proposed for rezoning or slight adjustments of proposed zone boundaries within that area, when the Planning Commission determines that the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning practice so require.\n\n\t2.\tWhere the City initiates changes of zone or height districts pursuant to California Government Code Section 65860(d) to a significant number of lots, publication in two newspapers of general circulation designated by the City Clerk for official advertising in the area involved, not less than ten days prior to the date of the public hearing, giving notice of its time, place and purpose shall be sufficient notice of the hearing, and the mailing of individual notices shall not be required.\n\n\tG.\tSpecial Zoning Classifications.\n\n\t1.\tT Classification.\n\n\t(a)\tPurpose.\u00a0 In the consideration of a proposed change of zone it may be determined that public necessity, convenience and general welfare require that provision be made for the orderly arrangement of the property concerned into lots and\/or that provision be made for adequate streets, drainage facilities, grading, sewers, utilities, park and recreational facilities; and\/or that provision be made for payments of fees in lieu of dedications and\/or that provision be made for other dedications; and\/or that provision be made for improvements; all in order that the property concerned and the area within which it is located may be properly developed in accordance with the different and additional uses to be permitted within the zone to which the property is proposed for change.\n\n\t(b)\tT Classification.\u00a0 Instead of immediately and finally rezoning the property or changing the height district, the ordinance shall place it in a T or Tentative classification pending the recordation of a Final Map in compliance with the provisions and requirements of Article 7 of this chapter, or, in certain instances hereinafter specified by the recordation of a Parcel Map in compliance with said provisions and requirements, or, where no map is necessary, by completion or assurance of all dedications, payments, and improvements which are required by the Council to be provided, to the satisfaction of the appropriate City departments.\u00a0 For the purposes of this Subsection, the term \u201cpayments\u201d shall include dedications or payments pursuant to Section 12.33 of this Chapter.\n\n\t(c)\tMap Symbol.\u00a0 The T or Tentative classification shall be indicated by the symbol T in parentheses preceding the proposed zoning designation; for example, (T)R4-2.\n\n\t(d)\tAllowed Uses.\u00a0 While property remains in the T Tentative classification, and until the Department of Building and Safety has received notification from the Department of the recordation of the Final Map or Parcel Map, or the completion or assurance of the required dedications, payments or improvements, which are to the satisfaction of the appropriate City departments in accordance with those conditions as have been imposed by the City Council, the property may continue to be used only for the purposes permitted in the zone applicable to the property prior to its T Tentative classification. No permits shall be issued, no buildings or structures shall be erected or constructed, and no land shall be used for any other purpose.\u00a0 Provided, however, that grading or other improvements which have been required as a prerequisite to the approval of the Final Map or Parcel Map or other required dedications, payments and improvements of the property may be accomplished.\u00a0 The Council may also permit the removal of the T Tentative classification by the recordation of a Parcel Map or by completion of all required dedications, payments and improvements in lieu of a Final Map after report and recommendations from the Director that all the necessary improvements can be accomplished and assured under Parcel Map procedures; or where no map is necessary, completion of all required dedications, payments and improvements.\n\n\t(e)\tTime Limit.\u00a0 Property shall remain in the T Tentative classification until a Final Map or a Parcel Map of the property has been approved by the Council and recorded in the County Recorder\u2019s Office, or until the Department has notified the Superintendent of Building of the completion to the satisfaction of the appropriate City agencies of all required dedications, payments and improvements, or until the classification expires as provided in this subsection.\u00a0 Unless otherwise authorized by the City Council, dedications, payments and improvements must be completed for the entire area subject to the change of zone.\n\n\t(f)\tRemoval of T.\u00a0 When a Final Map or Parcel Map has been approved by the Council and recorded, or the Superintendent of Building has been notified by the Department of the completion of all required dedications, payments, and improvements, the\u00a0 property shall no longer be designated as being within the T Tentative classification, the T Tentative designation shall be removed from City records, and the new zone designation shall become finally effective. The Council may authorize the removal of a T Tentative classification by any procedure which assures any appropriate dedications, payments or improvements including any dedication, payment or improvement described in Section 12.33 of this chapter.\u00a0 If the Tentative classification expires, the zone change and height district proceedings shall terminate and the property shall be redesignated as described in Paragraph (h) below.\n\n\t(g)\tAssurance of Dedications, Payments and Improvements.\u00a0 Prior to making a report and recommendation, the Director of Planning or his authorized representative shall obtain a report from the Bureau of Engineering as to whether all the necessary improvements can be accomplished and assured under Parcel Map procedures, or, if no map is necessary, without a map.\u00a0 The report shall be made within 40 calendar days of the date of request or within additional time as may be agreed upon by the Department and the Bureau of Engineering.\n\n\t(h)\tTime Limit.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5\/20\/12.)\u00a0 Except as provided in Subdivision 2. of this subsection, as to those properties placed in the T classification subsequent to March 26, 1973, property shall not remain in a T Tentative classification for more than six years after the effective date of the ordinance creating it without the recording of a Final Tract Map or a Final Parcel Map, or a decision by the Department that all required dedications, payments and improvements have been made or assured to the satisfaction of the appropriate City agencies.\n\n\tEXCEPTIONS:\u00a0 Property may remain in a T Tentative classification for an additional 60 months if the ordinance creating the classification took effect between July 15, 2005, and December 31, 2007; an additional 48 months if the ordinance took effect between January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008; and an additional 24 months if the ordinance took effect between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, provided that the Director makes a written finding that the prior discretionary approval and the required environmental review considered significant aspects of the approved project and that the existing environmental documentation under the California Environmental Quality Act is adequate for the issuance of the extension.\u00a0 Property may also remain in a T Tentative classification for a longer period of time through operation of Section 12.36 I. of the Code.\n\n\tWhen these time limitations expire, the T Tentative Zone classification and the zoning authorized thereby shall become null and void, the rezoning proceeding shall be terminated, and the property thereafter may only be utilized for those purposes permitted prior to the commencement of the rezoning proceedings and shall be so redesignated.\n\n\t(i)\tTime limit Does Not Include Moratoria.\u00a0 The time limit for property placed in a T Tentative classification which is also the subject of a Tentative Map shall not include any time during which a development moratorium, as defined in California Government Code Section 66452.6(b), has been imposed and is in existence after the effective date of the ordinance placing\u00a0 the property in a T Tentative classification, provided that\u00a0 the moratorium affects\u00a0 the property and does not exceed five years.\u00a0 Provided further that for property placed in a T Tentative Classification which is also the subject of a Tentative Map and which requires the expenditure of $125,000.00 or more to construct, improve, or finance the construction or improvement of public improvements outside the property boundaries of the Tentative Map, excluding improvements of public rights-of-way which abut the boundary of the property to be subdivided and which are reasonably related to the development of that property, then the T Tentative Classification shall be extended for the life of the Tentative Map.\n\n\t(j)\tRestoration to Former Zoning.\u00a0 Except as provided for in subdivision 2. of this subsection, as to those properties placed in the T Tentative classification prior to March 26, 1973 and which remain in a T Tentative classification for more than six years, the City Planning Commission, the Director or the Director\u2019s designee may investigate the circumstances therefor.\u00a0 When deemed appropriate by the Commission or upon the request of the Council, and after due notice to the owner of the property as shown on the records of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor, the City Planning Commission, the Director or the Director\u2019s designee shall submit a report and recommendation to the Council concerning the restoration of the property to its former zoning or height district classification. Where the recommendation is that the property be changed to its former classification, or when the Council requests that the property be changed to its former classification, an ordinance accomplishing the change shall be transmitted with the report and recommendation to the Council.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code to the contrary, no public hearing need be held nor further notice given as a prerequisite to the adoption of an ordinance restoring the property to its former classification.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff. 4\/10\/11.)\n\n\t(k)\tGeneral Plan Consistency.\u00a0 In the implementation of Paragraph (i) of this Subdivision, the former zoning or height district classification may be inconsistent with the current General Plan designation for the property.\u00a0 In this case, the property shall be changed to the least intense zoning or height district classification consistent with the General Plan.\n\n\t2.\tQ Qualified Classification.\n\n\t(a)\tPurpose.\u00a0 Except where property is being changed to the RA, RE, RS or R1 Zone, provision may be made in a zoning ordinance that the property not be utilized for all the uses ordinarily permitted in a particular zone classification and\/or that the development of the site shall conform to certain specified standards, if the limitations are deemed necessary to:\n\n\t(1)\tProtect the best interests of and assure a development more compatible with the surrounding property or neighborhood;\n\n\t(2)\tSecure an appropriate development in harmony with the objectives of the General Plan; or\n\n\t(3)\tPrevent or mitigate potential adverse environmental effects of the zone change.\n\n\t(b)\tQ Classification.\n\n\t(1)\tWhere limitations are deemed necessary the zoning ordinance may, instead of immediately and finally changing the zone or height district on the property, place it in a Q Qualified classification.\u00a0 Except as provided for in Paragraphs (f) of (g) of this subdivision, the Q Qualified classification shall be deemed to be a temporary classification until the time the proceedings are either terminated or completed as provided in this section.\n\n\t(2)\tPrior to the issuance of permits for the construction of buildings or structures authorized by the Qualified enactment, the plans for them shall be submitted to and approved by the Director as being in full compliance with all limitations and standards set forth in the ordinance.\n\n\t(c)\tMap Symbol.\u00a0 The Q classification shall be indicated by the symbol Q in parentheses preceding the proposed designation; for example, (Q)C2-1.\n\n\t(d)\tAllowed Uses.\u00a0 While property remains in a Q Qualified classification, whether temporary or permanent as provided for in Subdivision 3 of this subsection, it may be used for any of the uses permitted in the zone applicable to the property prior to its Q Qualified classification, unless the use or uses are prohibited in the zone classification to which the property is being changed, or are subject to limitations as are specified in the Qualified classification to which the property is being changed.\u00a0 Prior to the issuance of permits for the construction of buildings or structures authorized by reason of the Qualified zone enactment, the plans therefor must be submitted to and approved by the Director of Planning or by his designated representative as being in full compliance with all limitations and standards set forth in that ordinance.\n\n\t(e)\tCertificate of Occupancy.\u00a0 Property shall remain in a temporary (Q) Qualified classification for the period of time provided in Paragraph (f) of this subsection or until a Certificate of Occupancy is issued by the Superintendent of Building for one or more of the uses first permitted by the Qualified zone ordinance.\u00a0 The Superintendent of Building shall notify the Director of the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.\u00a0 Once the Certificate of Occupancy is issued: (i) the (Q) Qualified classification shall no longer be considered temporary; (ii) the parentheses shall be removed from the designation; and (iii) the new zone designation shall become finally effective and shall be placed on the appropriate City records with the symbol \u201cQ\u201d being a permanent part of the symbol designation; for example QR3-1.\u00a0 All applicable limitations and\/or standards within the Qualified classification ordinance shall thereafter be considered to apply permanently to the specific uses.\u00a0 The temporary Qualified classification and the accompanying conditions that have become permanent and are shown with brackets shall have the same status as those that have become permanent, but shown with neither parenthesis nor brackets.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 177,103, Eff. 12\/18\/05.)\n\n\t(f)\tTime Limit.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5\/20\/12.)\u00a0 Except as provided below and in Subsection I., property shall not remain in a Q Qualified classification for more than six years unless during that time:\n\n\t(1)\tthere is substantial physical development of the property to allow for one or more of the uses for which the Q Qualified classification was adopted; or\n\n\t(2)\tif no physical development is necessary, then the property is used for one or more of the purposes for which the Q Qualified classification was adopted.\n\n\tEXCEPTION:\u00a0 Property may remain in a Q Qualified classification for an additional 60 months if the ordinance creating the classification took effect between July 15, 2005, and December 31, 2007; an additional 48 months if the ordinance took effect between January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008; and an additional 24 months if the ordinance took effect between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, provided that the Director makes a written finding that the prior discretionary approval and the required environmental review considered significant aspects of the approved project and that the existing environmental documentation under the California Environmental Quality Act is adequate for the issuance of the extension.\n\n\tWhen these time limitations expire, the Q Qualified classification and the authority contained therein shall become null and void, the rezoning proceedings shall be terminated, and the property thereafter may only be utilized for those purposes permitted prior to the commencement of the rezoning proceedings.\n\n\tIn addition, the Director may determine that the development has not been continuously and expeditiously carried on to completion, but that one or more usable units has been completed and that the partial development will meet the requirements for the utilization of the (Q) classification.\u00a0 The Director may impose conditions on the partial development to meet the intent of this subdivision.\u00a0 The Director shall advise the Department of Building and Safety of his or her decision.\u00a0 Thereafter, a Certificate of Occupancy may be issued after compliance with the Director\u2019s decision, and the temporary (Q) classification shall be permanent on that portion of the property determined by the Director to be appropriate to the completed portion of the development.\u00a0 The Qualified classification and the authority contained therein shall become null and void as to the remainder of the property.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no public hearing need be held nor notice be given before terminating the (Q) Qualified classification and restricting the property to its previously permitted uses.\n\n\t(g)\tNon-Conforming Improvements.\u00a0 In the event that buildings or structures designed for occupancy by uses which were not permitted prior to the (Q) Qualified classification are located on property on which the (Q) Qualified classification is terminated, the buildings or structures shall be completely removed forthwith by the owner at his or her own expense, unless their design is altered and they are immediately completed in full compliance with all applicable regulations for uses permitted prior to the (Q) Qualified classification.\n\n\t(h)\tQ\u2019s with T\u2019s.\u00a0 Property may simultaneously be classified as being in a (Q) or [Q] Qualified classification and T Tentative classification.\u00a0 The T designation shall be removed prior to utilization of the additional uses permitted by the (Q) or [Q] Qualified classification.\u00a0 In no event shall there be any change in the time limitations of this section or any extension of them.\n\n\t(i)\tTime Limit Does Not Include Moratoria.\u00a0 However, for property placed in a Q Qualified classification which is also the subject of a Tentative Map, the six year time period for the Q Qualified Classification shall not include any time during which a development moratorium, as defined in California Government Code Section 66452.6(f), has been imposed and is in existence after the effective date of the ordinance placing the property in a Q Qualified Classification, provided that the moratorium affects the property and does not exceed five years.\u00a0 Provided further that for property placed in a Q Qualified Classification which is also the subject of a Tentative Map and which requires the expenditure of $125,000.00 or more to construct, improve, or finance the construction or improvement of public improvements outside the property boundaries of the Tentative Map, excluding improvements of public rights-of-way which abut the boundary of the property to be subdivided and which are reasonably related to the development of that property, then the Q Qualified classification shall be extended for the life of the Tentative Map, including any time extensions approved by the Advisory Agency.\u00a0 For the purposes of this subsection, a zone change or height district change shall be deemed a change incident to division of land when the project\u2019s environmental analysis includes a description of both the change and the division of land, and the proposed development of the site does not deviate substantially from the original project description.\u00a0 In particular, the proposed development shall be substantially the same regarding density, the number of dwelling units, the amount of floor area, uses, height and massing of buildings, amount of grading, and other relevant attributes.\n\n\t(j)\tQ Conditions in the RA, RE, RS and R1 Zones.\u00a0 (Added by Ord.

for example, C2-1-L-D, R4-2-D, RD1.5-1-VL-D, etc.).\n\n\t(d)\tPermanence of D Development Limitations.\u00a0 D Development limitations shall not be affected by any failure to remove a (T) Tentative classification or the parentheses of a Q Qualified classification.\n\n\tH.\tAmendments of the T Classification and Clarifications of the Q Classification or D Limitation.\n\n\t1.\tApplication.\u00a0 A request for an amendment of Council\u2019s instructions involving the T Classification or a clarification of a Q Classification or D Limitation set forth in an ordinance pursuant to Subsections C and G of this section may be filed by one or more of the owners or lessees of the subject property with the Department on a form accompanied by information required by the Department and by a fee as provided in Section 19.01.\n\n\t2.\tGuidelines.\u00a0 The City Planning Commission shall adopt guidelines for the Director to utilize in considering these requests.\u00a0 The City Planning Commission may amend the guidelines from time to time as it deems appropriate.\n\n\t3.\tHearing.\u00a0 Proceedings for an amendment to Council instructions or a clarification need not be set for hearing.\n\n\t4.\tDirector\u2019s Authority.\n\n\t(a)\tApproval of Request.\u00a0 If the Director decides that the request complies with the City Planning Commission\u2019s guidelines, then the Director may approve or conditionally approve a request subject to the findings below.\n\n\t(b)\tDisapproval of Request.\u00a0 If the Director decides that the request does not comply with the City Planning Commission guidelines for considering requests for amendments or clarifications, the Director shall deny the request.\u00a0 The decision of the Director that a request does not comply with the City Planning Commission guidelines shall be final.\n\n\t5.\tFindings.\u00a0 The Director, or the City Council on appeal, shall approve an amendment or clarification if the Director or the City Council finds that:\n\n\t(a)\tThe request is consistent with the City Planning Commission guidelines; and\n\n\t(b)\tThe amendment or clarification is necessary in order to carry out the intent of the City Council in adopting the T or Q Classification or D Limitation; and\n\n\t(c)\tThe amendment or clarification would have only a minimal effect on adjacent property and would not result in a significant or substantial deprivation of the property rights of other property owners.\n\n\t6.\tNotice of Decision.\n\n\t(a)\tNotice.\u00a0 After making a decision pursuant to this subsection, the Director or City Clerk, as appropriate, shall notify the applicant in writing.\u00a0 Written notice shall also be mailed to the owners of all property within and outside of the City that is within 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved, using for the purpose of notification the last known name and address of\u00a0 owners\u00a0 shown upon the records of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

for\npayments of fees in lieu of dedications and\/or that provision be made for other\ndedications; and\/or that provision be made for improvements; all in order that\nthe property concerned and the area within which it is located may be properly\ndeveloped in accordance with the different and additional uses to be permitted\nwithin the zone to which the property is proposed for change.\t(b)\tT\nClassification.\u00a0 Instead of immediately and finally rezoning the property or\nchanging the height district, the ordinance shall place it in a T or Tentative\nclassification pending the recordation of a Final Map in compliance with the\nprovisions and requirements of Article 7 of this chapter, or, in certain\ninstances hereinafter specified by the recordation of a Parcel Map in compliance\nwith said provisions and requirements, or, where no map is necessary, by\ncompletion or assurance of all dedications, payments, and improvements which are\nrequired by the Council

recordation of the Final Map or Parcel\nMap, or the completion or assurance of the required dedications, payments or\nimprovements, which are to the satisfaction of the appropriate City departments\nin accordance with those conditions as have been imposed by the City Council,\nthe property may continue to be used only for the purposes permitted in the zone\napplicable to the property prior to its T Tentative classification. No permits\nshall be issued, no buildings or structures shall be erected or constructed, and\nno land shall be used for any other purpose.\u00a0 Provided, however, that grading\nor other improvements which have been required as a prerequisite to the approval\nof the Final Map or Parcel Map or other required dedications, payments and\nimprovements of the property may be accomplished.\u00a0 The Council may also permit\nthe removal of the T Tentative classification by the recordation of a Parcel Map\nor by completion of all required dedications, payments and improvements in lieu\nof a Final Map after report and recommendations from the Director that all the\nnecessary improvements can be accomplished and assured under Parcel Map\nprocedures; or where no map is necessary, completion of all required\ndedications, payments and improvements.\t(e)\tTime Limit.\u00a0 Property shall remain\nin the T Tentative classification until a Final Map or a Parcel Map of the\nproperty has been approved by the Council and recorded in the County\nRecorder\u2019s Office, or until the Department has notified the Superintendent of\nBuilding of the completion to the satisfaction of the appropriate City agencies\nof all required dedications, payments and improvements, or until the\nclassification expires as provided in this subsection.\u00a0 Unless otherwise\nauthorized by the City Council, dedications, payments and improvements must be\ncompleted for the entire area subject to the change of zone.\t(f)\tRemoval of T.\u00a0\nWhen a Final Map or Parcel Map has been approved by the Council and recorded, or\nthe Superintendent of Building has been notified by the Department of the\ncompletion of all required dedications, payments, and improvements, the\u00a0\nproperty shall no longer be designated as being within the T Tentative\nclassification, the T Tentative designation shall be removed from City records,\nand the new zone designation shall become finally effective. The Council may\nauthorize the removal of a T Tentative classification by any procedure which\nassures any appropriate dedications, payments or improvements including any\ndedication, payment or improvement described in Section 12.33 of this chapter.\u00a0\nIf the Tentative classification expires, the zone change and height district\nproceedings shall terminate and the property shall be redesignated as described\nin Paragraph (h) below.\t(g)\tAssurance of Dedications, Payments and\nImprovements.\u00a0 Prior to making a report and recommendation, the Director of\nPlanning or his authorized representative shall obtain a report from the Bureau\nof Engineering as to whether all the necessary improvements can be accomplished\nand assured under Parcel Map procedures, or, if no map is necessary, without a\nmap.\u00a0 The report shall be made within 40 calendar days of the date of request\nor within additional time as may be agreed upon by the Department and the Bureau\nof Engineering.\t(h)\tTime Limit.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

Changes.\u00a0 The procedures for changes of zoning or height districts shall be as set forth in Subsections A through D, with the following additional regulations:<br \/><br \/>\t1.\tIn the consideration of an application for a proposed land use <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> involving a change of zone, the Planning Commission may approve or disapprove a change upon all or only a part of the subject area.\u00a0 The Planning Commission may recommend a change to any zone between that existing on the property and that requested in the application, as determined by the Planning Commission, or may recommend, on all or a portion of the property, a change to a P or PB Zone, or may recommend that an M Zone be changed to an MR Zone.\u00a0 The Planning Commission may, without additional notice or <span class=\"dictionary\">hearing<\/span>, recommend <span class=\"dictionary\">minor<\/span> additions to the area proposed for rezoning or slight adjustments of proposed zone boundaries within that area, when the Planning Commission determines that the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning practice so require.<br \/><br \/>\t2.\tWhere the City initiates changes of zone or height districts pursuant to California Government Code Section 65860(d) to a significant number of lots, publication in two newspapers of general circulation designated by the City Clerk for official advertising in the area involved, not less than ten days prior to the date of the public <span class=\"dictionary\">hearing<\/span>, giving notice of its time, place and purpose shall be sufficient notice of the <span class=\"dictionary\">hearing<\/span>, and the mailing of individual notices shall not be required.<br \/><br \/>\tG.\tSpecial Zoning Classifications.<br \/><br \/>\t1.\tT Classification.<br \/><br \/>\t(a)\tPurpose.\u00a0 In the consideration of a proposed change of zone it may be determined that public necessity, convenience and general welfare require that provision be made for the orderly arrangement of the property concerned into lots and\/or that provision be made for adequate streets, drainage facilities, grading, sewers, utilities, park and recreational facilities; and\/or that provision be made for payments of fees in lieu of dedications and\/or that provision be made for other dedications; and\/or that provision be made for improvements; all in <span class=\"dictionary\">order<\/span> that the property concerned and the area within which it is located may be properly developed in accordance with the different and additional uses to be permitted within the zone to which the property is proposed for change.<br \/><br \/>\t(b)\tT Classification.\u00a0 Instead of immediately and finally rezoning the property or changing the height district, the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> shall place it in a T or Tentative classification pending the recordation of a Final Map in compliance with the provisions and requirements of Article 7 of this chapter, or, in certain instances hereinafter specified by the recordation of a Parcel Map in compliance with said provisions and requirements, or, where no map is necessary, by completion or assurance of all dedications, payments, and improvements which are required by the Council to be provided, to the satisfaction of the appropriate City departments.\u00a0 For the purposes of this Subsection, the term \u201cpayments\u201d shall include dedications or payments pursuant to Section 12.33 of this Chapter.<br \/><br \/>\t(c)\tMap Symbol.\u00a0 The T or Tentative classification shall be indicated by the symbol T in parentheses preceding the proposed zoning designation; for example, (T)R4-2.<br \/><br \/>\t(d)\tAllowed Uses.\u00a0 While property remains in the T Tentative classification, and until the Department of Building and Safety has received notification from the Department of the recordation of the Final Map or Parcel Map, or the completion or assurance of the required dedications, payments or improvements, which are to the satisfaction of the appropriate City departments in accordance with those conditions as have been imposed by the City Council, the property may continue to be used only for the purposes permitted in the zone applicable to the property prior to its T Tentative classification. No permits shall be issued, no buildings or structures shall be erected or constructed, and no land shall be used for any other purpose.\u00a0 Provided, however, that grading or other improvements which have been required as a prerequisite to the approval of the Final Map or Parcel Map or other required dedications, payments and improvements of the property may be accomplished.\u00a0 The Council may also permit the removal of the T Tentative classification by the recordation of a Parcel Map or by completion of all required dedications, payments and improvements in lieu of a Final Map after report and recommendations from the Director that all the necessary improvements can be accomplished and assured under Parcel Map procedures; or where no map is necessary, completion of all required dedications, payments and improvements.<br \/><br \/>\t(e)\tTime Limit.\u00a0 Property shall remain in the T Tentative classification until a Final Map or a Parcel Map of the property has been approved by the Council and recorded in the County Recorder\u2019s Office, or until the Department has notified the Superintendent of Building of the completion to the satisfaction of the appropriate City agencies of all required dedications, payments and improvements, or until the classification expires as provided in this subsection.\u00a0 Unless otherwise authorized by the City Council, dedications, payments and improvements must be completed for the entire area subject to the change of zone.<br \/><br \/>\t(f)\tRemoval of T.\u00a0 When a Final Map or Parcel Map has been approved by the Council and recorded, or the Superintendent of Building has been notified by the Department of the completion of all required dedications, payments, and improvements, the\u00a0 property shall no longer be designated as being within the T Tentative classification, the T Tentative designation shall be removed from City records, and the new zone designation shall become finally effective. The Council may authorize the removal of a T Tentative classification by any procedure which assures any appropriate dedications, payments or improvements including any dedication, payment or improvement described in Section 12.33 of this chapter.\u00a0 If the Tentative classification expires, the zone change and height district proceedings shall terminate and the property shall be redesignated as described in Paragraph (h) below.<br \/><br \/>\t(g)\tAssurance of Dedications, Payments and Improvements.\u00a0 Prior to making a report and recommendation, the Director of Planning or his authorized representative shall obtain a report from the Bureau of Engineering as to whether all the necessary improvements can be accomplished and assured under Parcel Map procedures, or, if no map is necessary, without a map.\u00a0 The report shall be made within 40 calendar days of the date of request or within additional time as may be agreed upon by the Department and the Bureau of Engineering.<br \/><br \/>\t(h)\tTime Limit.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5\/20\/12.)\u00a0 Except as provided in Subdivision 2. of this subsection, as to those properties placed in the T classification subsequent to March 26, 1973, property shall not remain in a T Tentative classification for more than six years after the effective date of the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> creating it without the recording of a Final Tract Map or a Final Parcel Map, or a decision by the Department that all required dedications, payments and improvements have been made or assured to the satisfaction of the appropriate City agencies.<br \/><br \/>\tEXCEPTIONS:\u00a0 Property may remain in a T Tentative classification for an additional 60 months if the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> creating the classification took effect between July 15, 2005, and December 31, 2007; an additional 48 months if the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> took effect between January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008; and an additional 24 months if the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> took effect between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, provided that the Director makes a written <span class=\"dictionary\">finding<\/span> that the prior discretionary approval and the required environmental review considered significant aspects of the approved project and that the existing environmental documentation under the California Environmental Quality Act is adequate for the issuance of the extension.\u00a0 Property may also remain in a T Tentative classification for a longer period of time through operation of Section 12.36 I. of the Code.<br \/><br \/>\tWhen these time limitations expire, the T Tentative Zone classification and the zoning authorized thereby shall become null and void, the rezoning proceeding shall be terminated, and the property thereafter may only be utilized for those purposes permitted prior to the commencement of the rezoning proceedings and shall be so redesignated.<br \/><br \/>\t(i)\tTime limit Does Not Include Moratoria.\u00a0 The time limit for property placed in a T Tentative classification which is also the subject of a Tentative Map shall not include any time during which a development moratorium, as defined in California Government Code Section 66452.6(b), has been imposed and is in existence after the effective date of the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> placing\u00a0 the property in a T Tentative classification, provided that\u00a0 the moratorium affects\u00a0 the property and does not exceed five years.\u00a0 Provided further that for property placed in a T Tentative Classification which is also the subject of a Tentative Map and which requires the expenditure of $125,000.00 or more to construct, improve, or finance the construction or improvement of public improvements outside the property boundaries of the Tentative Map, excluding improvements of public rights-of-way which abut the boundary of the property to be subdivided and which are reasonably related to the development of that property, then the T Tentative Classification shall be extended for the life of the Tentative Map.<br \/><br \/>\t(j)\tRestoration to Former Zoning.\u00a0 Except as provided for in subdivision 2. of this subsection, as to those properties placed in the T Tentative classification prior to March 26, 1973 and which remain in a T Tentative classification for more than six years, the City Planning Commission, the Director or the Director\u2019s designee may investigate the circumstances therefor.\u00a0 When deemed appropriate by the Commission or upon the request of the Council, and after due notice to the owner of the property as shown on the records of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor, the City Planning Commission, the Director or the Director\u2019s designee shall submit a report and recommendation to the Council concerning the restoration of the property to its former zoning or height district classification. Where the recommendation is that the property be changed to its former classification, or when the Council requests that the property be changed to its former classification, an <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> accomplishing the change shall be transmitted with the report and recommendation to the Council.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code to the contrary, no public <span class=\"dictionary\">hearing<\/span> need be held nor further notice given as a prerequisite to the adoption of an <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> restoring the property to its former classification.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff. 4\/10\/11.)<br \/><br \/>\t(k)\tGeneral Plan Consistency.\u00a0 In the implementation of Paragraph (i) of this Subdivision, the former zoning or height district classification may be inconsistent with the current General Plan designation for the property.\u00a0 In this case, the property shall be changed to the least intense zoning or height district classification consistent with the General Plan.<br \/><br \/>\t2.\tQ Qualified Classification.<br \/><br \/>\t(a)\tPurpose.\u00a0 Except where property is being changed to the RA, RE, RS or R1 Zone, provision may be made in a zoning <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> that the property not be utilized for all the uses ordinarily permitted in a particular zone classification and\/or that the development of the site shall conform to certain specified standards, if the limitations are deemed necessary to:<br \/><br \/>\t(1)\tProtect the best interests of and assure a development more compatible with the surrounding property or neighborhood;<br \/><br \/>\t(2)\tSecure an appropriate development in harmony with the objectives of the General Plan; or<br \/><br \/>\t(3)\tPrevent or mitigate potential adverse environmental effects of the zone change.<br \/><br \/>\t(b)\tQ Classification.<br \/><br \/>\t(1)\tWhere limitations are deemed necessary the zoning <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> may, instead of immediately and finally changing the zone or height district on the property, place it in a Q Qualified classification.\u00a0 Except as provided for in Paragraphs (f) of (g) of this subdivision, the Q Qualified classification shall be deemed to be a temporary classification until the time the proceedings are either terminated or completed as provided in this section.<br \/><br \/>\t(2)\tPrior to the issuance of permits for the construction of buildings or structures authorized by the Qualified enactment, the plans for them shall be submitted to and approved by the Director as being in full compliance with all limitations and standards set forth in the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>\t(c)\tMap Symbol.\u00a0 The Q classification shall be indicated by the symbol Q in parentheses preceding the proposed designation; for example, (Q)C2-1.<br \/><br \/>\t(d)\tAllowed Uses.\u00a0 While property remains in a Q Qualified classification, whether temporary or permanent as provided for in Subdivision 3 of this subsection, it may be used for any of the uses permitted in the zone applicable to the property prior to its Q Qualified classification, unless the use or uses are prohibited in the zone classification to which the property is being changed, or are subject to limitations as are specified in the Qualified classification to which the property is being changed.\u00a0 Prior to the issuance of permits for the construction of buildings or structures authorized by reason of the Qualified zone enactment, the plans therefor must be submitted to and approved by the Director of Planning or by his designated representative as being in full compliance with all limitations and standards set forth in that <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>\t(e)\tCertificate of Occupancy.\u00a0 Property shall remain in a temporary (Q) Qualified classification for the period of time provided in Paragraph (f) of this subsection or until a Certificate of Occupancy is issued by the Superintendent of Building for one or more of the uses first permitted by the Qualified zone <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span>.\u00a0 The Superintendent of Building shall notify the Director of the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.\u00a0 Once the Certificate of Occupancy is issued: (i) the (Q) Qualified classification shall no longer be considered temporary; (ii) the parentheses shall be removed from the designation; and (iii) the new zone designation shall become finally effective and shall be placed on the appropriate City records with the symbol \u201cQ\u201d being a permanent part of the symbol designation; for example QR3-1.\u00a0 All applicable limitations and\/or standards within the Qualified classification <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> shall thereafter be considered to apply permanently to the specific uses.\u00a0 The temporary Qualified classification and the accompanying conditions that have become permanent and are shown with brackets shall have the same status as those that have become permanent, but shown with neither parenthesis nor brackets.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord.

also the subject of a Tentative Map, the six year time period for the Q Qualified Classification shall not include any time during which a development moratorium, as defined in California Government Code Section 66452.6(f), has been imposed and is in existence after the effective date of the <span class=\"dictionary\">ordinance<\/span> placing the property in a Q Qualified Classification, provided that the moratorium affects the property and does not exceed five years.\u00a0 Provided further that for property placed in a Q Qualified Classification which is also the subject of a
