	(Added by Ord. No. 174,552, Eff. 6/16/02.)

	A.	Purpose.&#xA0; This section sets forth procedures, guidelines and standards for the establishment of &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign Districts in areas of the City, the unique characteristics of which can be enhanced by the imposition of special sign regulations designed to enhance the theme or unique qualities of that district, or which eliminate blight through a sign reduction program.

	B.	Establishment of Districts.&#xA0; The procedures set forth in Section 12.32S shall be followed, however each &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign District shall include only properties in the C or M Zones, except that R5 Zone properties may be included in a &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign District provided that the R5 zoned lot is located within an area designated on an adopted community plan as a &#x201C;Regional Center,&#x201D; &#x201C;Regional Commercial,&#x201D; or &#x201C;High Intensity Commercial,&#x201D; or within any redevelopment project area.&#xA0; No &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign District shall contain less than one block or three acres in area, whichever is the smaller.&#xA0; The total acreage in the district shall include contiguous parcels of land which may only be separated by public streets, ways or alleys, or other physical features, or as set forth in the rules approved by the Director of Planning.&#xA0; Precise boundaries are required at the time of application for or initiation of an individual district.

	C.	Development Regulations.&#xA0; The Department of Building and Safety shall not issue a building permit for a sign within a &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign District unless the sign conforms to the regulations set forth in a specific &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign District ordinance.&#xA0; The development regulations for each &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign District shall be determined at the time the district is established, except that definitions shall conform with those found in Section 91.6203 of this Code, if defined in that section.&#xA0; The sign regulations shall enhance the character of the district by addressing the location, number, square footage, height, light illumination, hours of illumination, sign reduction program, duration of signs, design and types of signs permitted, as well as other characteristics, and can include murals, supergraphics, and other on-site and off-site signs.&#xA0; However, the regulations for a &#x201C;SN&#x201D; Sign District cannot supersede the regulations of an Historic Preservation Overlay District, a legally-adopted specific plan, supplemental use district or zoning regulation needed to implement the provisions of an approved development agreement.</full_text><order_by>11</order_by><ancestry><unit id="43" label="article"><name>Specific Plan &#x2013; Zoning
