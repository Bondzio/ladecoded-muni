Any person engaging in, conducting, managing, selling, exchanging, displaying or offering for sale or exchange, secondhand personal property at a swap meet is exempt from Subsections (a) through (h), inclusive, of this section, and any rules and regulations promulgated by the Board pursuant to said subsections, but is subject to the following provisions and conditions:\n\n\t1.\tDefinitions.\u00a0 As used in this subsection:\n\n\ta.\t\u201cSwap Meet\u201d means any event where secondhand goods are offered or displayed for sale or exchange and\n\n\t(1)\tA fee is charged for the privilege of offering or displaying secondhand goods for sale or exchange; or\n\n\t(2)\tA fee is charged to prospective buyers for admission to the area where secondhand goods are offered or displayed for sale or exchange.\n\n\tb.\t\u201cSwap Meet Operator\u201d means any individual, partnership, corporation, business association or other person or entity which sponsors, controls, manages or otherwise conducts a swap meet.\n\n\tc.\t\u201cSwap Meet Vendor\u201d means any individual, partnership, corporation, business association or other person or entity which sells, exchanges, displays, or offers for sale or exchange, any secondhand goods at a swap meet.\n\n\t2.\tPermit Required.\u00a0 No person or entity shall operate a swap meet without a written permit from the Board, except that a permit shall not be required for any event sponsored by and for the exclusive benefit of any community chest, fund, foundation, association or corporation organized and operated solely for religious or charitable purposes provided that no portion of any admission fee charged swap meet vendors or prospective purchasers, or the receipts from the sale or exchange of new or secondhand goods, inures to the benefit of any shareholder, officer, employee, person or entity organizing, sponsoring or conducting such event.\n\n\ta.\tNo permit shall be issued which will permit the sale or display of firearms, flammables, and hash pipes or other manipulative instruments relating to the use or consumption of drugs or their derivatives.\n\n\tb.\tNo permit shall be issued unless the swap meet operator has first obtained a business tax registration certificate.\n\n\tc.\tNo permit shall be issued for a swap meet requiring a conditional use pursuant to Section 12.24 of this Code until such conditional use has been obtained.\n\n\td.\tWhen the Board has determined that the cost of police investigation services will be increased because of the operation of a swap meet, the Board may require the swap meet operator to make payment into the general fund of the City of Los Angeles an amount calculated at the current hourly rate of a Detective II for each hour of investigation on a weekday and 150% of the current hourly rate of a Detective II for each hour of investigation on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday involving the swap meet, or up to a maximum of 16 hours per day of swap meet operation, plus 23.1% of such amount for administrative costs. The swap meet operator shall pay the amount due to the Office of Finance within 30 days after the bill is mailed to the swap meet operator by the Board. (Amended by Ord.

Failure on the part of the swap meet operator to verify the above information is grounds for the Police Department to close the swap meet. (Added by Ord.
