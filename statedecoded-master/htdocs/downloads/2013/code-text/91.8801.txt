PURPOSE. (§ 91.8801)

  PURPOSE.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)	The purpose of this division is to
promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that
may result from the effects of earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall
buildings constructed before 1934. Such buildings have been widely recognized
for their sustaining of life hazardous damage as a result of partial or complete
collapse during past moderate to strong earthquakes.	The provisions of this
division are minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established
primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life or injury and will not necessarily
prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing
building which complies with these standards. This division shall not require
existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire-safety systems to be altered
unless they constitute a hazard to life or property.	This division provides
systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of
unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings based on their current use.
Priorities, time periods and standards are also established under which these
buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and anchored. Where the
analysis determines deficiencies, this division requires the building to be
strengthened or demolished.
