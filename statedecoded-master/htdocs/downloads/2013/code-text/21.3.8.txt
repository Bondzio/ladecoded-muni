Finance shall have the power and duty and is hereby directed to enforce each and
all of the provisions of this article.	(b)	In administering and enforcing the
provisions of this article, the Director of Finance shall have the same powers
and duties with respect to collecting the tax provided herein as he has under

provisions of Sections 21.17, 21.20, and 21.21 of this chapter shall apply to
the administration and collection of the tax imposed under the provisions of

that efficiency in the administration of the tax would be promoted, he may
establish reporting periods greater than quarterly, but not to exceed one year,
for lessors who rent only occasionally. The Director of Finance may establish
shorter reporting periods for any lessor if he deems it necessary in order to
insure collection of the tax.
