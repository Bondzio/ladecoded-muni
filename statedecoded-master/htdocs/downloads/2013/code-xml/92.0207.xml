	2.	Materials for Enclosure Wall and Ceiling Lining:&#xA0; Materials used to furnish the inside surfaces of the enclosure shall be incombustible or shall be bonded flat to the enclosure and have a flame spread rating of 50 or less and a smoke density of 300 or less when tested in accordance with ASTM E84, UL 723 or NFPA 255.

	3.	Plastic Luminous Ceilings in Elevator Enclosures:

	(a)	Flame spread shall not exceed 50 and smoke density shall not exceed 300 when tested according to ASTM E84, UL 723 or NFPA 255.

	(b)	The self-ignition temperature shall be 650 or greater when tested according to ASTM D 1929-68.&#xA0;

	4.	Combustible materials used in the enclosure wall and ceiling shall be specifically approved by the Department.&#xA0;

	(e)	Speed Governor Marking Plate. The manufacturer&#x2019;s type designation shall be added to the data shown on the Speed-Governor marking plate required by Rule 206. 9 of ASME A17.1-1996.
