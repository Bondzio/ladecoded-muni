DUTY TO COLLECT AND REMIT TAX. (§ 21.3.5)

  DUTY TO COLLECT AND REMIT TAX.	(a)	The tax imposed by this article shall be
collected from the tenant by the lessor. The amount of tax collected in one
calendar quarter shall be remitted to the Director of Finance on or before the
last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter. The tax
shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as and along with the
charges made in accordance with the lessor’s regular billing practice. If the
amount paid by a tenant is less than the full amount of the charge and the tax
which has accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the
charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid.	(b)	The duty to collect
tax from a tenant shall commence with the first payment of charges by the tenant
on or after the operative date of this article.
