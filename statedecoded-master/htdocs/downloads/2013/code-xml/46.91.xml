	(a)	It shall be a misdemeanor for any person or proprietor, within the City of Los Angeles, to act as a tobacco retailer at a location for which a valid Tobacco Retailer&#x2019;s Permit has not been issued pursuant to this article.&#xA0; A separate Tobacco Retailer&#x2019;s Permit is required for each location at which tobacco retailing is to occur.&#xA0; No permit shall be issued to authorize tobacco retailing at any place other than a fixed location.&#xA0; Tobacco retailing from any non- permanent location, including from vehicles, is prohibited.&#xA0; No permit shall be issued for residences, newsstands, or locations where engaging in tobacco retailing is prohibited by federal, state or local law.
