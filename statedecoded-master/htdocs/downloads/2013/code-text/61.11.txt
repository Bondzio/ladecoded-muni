EXPEDITED PERMIT SURCHARGE. (§ 61.11)

  EXPEDITED PERMIT SURCHARGE.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9/28/12.)	An applicant for any permit issued
by the Bureau of Engineering may pay a surcharge to obtain expedited Bureau
permit-related services.  The amount of the surcharge shall be the total cost
of the overtime hours worked by Bureau of Engineering staff to provide the
permit-related services (direct salary multiplied by 1.5), plus a 40 percent
surcharge.  When an applicant for any permit issued by the Bureau of
Engineering elects to obtain expedited Bureau permit-related services, the
applicant must pay, before the Bureau provides any expedited services, a deposit
in an amount that the Bureau estimates will be total cost of providing the
expedited services.	For Bureau of Engineering expedited services provided
pursuant to the provisions of this Section, if before completion of providing
the requested services the Bureau determines that additional funds are needed to
compensate the Bureau for the total cost of providing expedited services, the
Bureau may halt all work on the project for which the application was made and
require the applicant to pay the amount that the Bureau estimates will be needed
to compensate the Bureau for the total cost of providing the requested
services.  At the conclusion of providing the requested services, if total
costs are less than the amount deposited, the applicant shall be refunded the
difference.  The Bureau of Engineering shall not issue or approve any permit
until all monies owed pursuant to the provisions of this Section are paid.
