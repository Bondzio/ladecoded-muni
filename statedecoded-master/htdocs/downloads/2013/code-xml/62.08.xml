	(Added by Ord. No. 175,014, Eff. 1/29/03; Renumbered from Sec. 62.03.2 by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9/28/12.)

	The following Above Ground Facilities Specifications and Procedures (AGFSP) shall govern the approval process for the installation of above ground facilities (AGFs) in the public rights-of-way.

	I.	AGF Definition:&#xA0; The AGF shall be defined as all structures, cabinets, electric meters, and any other appurtenance installed for telecommunication or utility purposes above surrounding grade in the public rights-of-way. For the purposes of reviewing allowable AGF Applications, all structures, cabinets, electric meters, and any other appurtenances that share a common structural foundation shall be defined as one AGF. All structures, cabinets, electric meters, and any other appurtenances required to operate a facility, but that do not share a common structural foundation, shall be considered a separate AGF installation. The number of separate AGF installations shall be based on the number of separate structural foundations installed when the facility is fully operational.

	ADA:&#xA0; The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law on July 26, 1990. The ADA includes a wide range of legislation intended to make American Society more accessible to people with disabilities. It is divided into five titles, one of which is Public Accommodations (Title III). Title III states that all new construction and modifications must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. For existing facilities, barriers to services must be removed if readily achievable.

	Design Review Board:&#xA0; In approximately one-third of the City&#x2019;s Specific Plans, development plans must be reviewed and approved by a Design Review Board. This Board is composed of members appointed pursuant to Section 16.50 of the LAMC.

	Major Highway:&#xA0; A Major Highway is a street classification designated under the Transportation Element of the General Plan for the City of Los Angeles.

SPECIFICATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR ABOVE GROUND FACILITIES INSTALLATIONS IN THE
PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY. (&#xA7; 62.08)

&#xA0; SPECIFICATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR ABOVE GROUND FACILITIES INSTALLATIONS IN
THE PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
	(Added by Ord. No. 175,014, Eff. 1/29/03; Renumbered from Sec. 62.03.2 by Ord.
No. 182,237, Eff. 9/28/12.)	The following Above Ground Facilities Specifications
and Procedures (AGFSP) shall govern the approval process for the installation of
above ground facilities (AGFs) in the public rights-of-way.	I.	AGF Definition:&#xA0;
The AGF shall be defined as all structures, cabinets, electric meters, and any
other appurtenance installed for telecommunication or utility purposes above
surrounding grade in the public rights-of-way. For the purposes of reviewing
allowable AGF Applications, all structures, cabinets, electric meters, and any
other appurtenances that share a common structural foundation shall be defined
as one AGF. All structures, cabinets, electric meters, and any other
appurtenances required to operate a facility, but that do not share a common
structural foundation, shall be considered a separate AGF installation. The
number of separate AGF installations shall be based on the number of separate
structural foundations installed when the facility is fully operational.	ADA:&#xA0;
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law on July 26, 1990.
The ADA includes a wide range of legislation intended to make American Society
more accessible to people with disabilities. It is divided into five titles, one
of which is Public Accommodations (Title III). Title III states that all new
construction and modifications must be accessible to individuals with
disabilities. For existing facilities, barriers to services must be removed if
readily achievable.	Design Review Board:&#xA0; In approximately one-third of the
City&#x2019;s Specific Plans, development plans must be reviewed and approved by a
Design Review Board. This Board is composed of members appointed pursuant to
Section 16.50 of the LAMC.	Major Highway:&#xA0; A Major Highway is a street
classification designated under the Transportation Element of the General Plan
for the City of Los Angeles. A street designated a Major Highway is projected to
carry more than 30,000 average daily trips by the year 2010. The current
standard right-of-way cross sectional width of such a street is 104&#x2032; or
greater and includes a 12&#x2032; wide sidewalk/parkway, 13&#x2032; curb lane, 4 to 6
full-time through lanes, 2 part-time parking lanes, and I median/left turn
lane.	Note:	certain Community Plans and Specific Plans within the City of Los
Angeles have established modified designations and/or standards for some
specific highways or highway segments.	Public Rights-of-Way:&#xA0; Land that is
dedicated for public use including but not limited to: improved public streets,
sidewalks, curbs, gutters, public utility easements, parkways. etc., as well as
dedicated unimproved areas.	Secondary Highway: A Secondary Highway is a street
classification designated under the Transportation Element of the General Plan
for the City of Los Angeles. A street designated a Secondary Highway is
projected to carry between 20,000 and 30,000 average daily trips by the year
2010. The current standard right-of-way cross sectional width of such a street
is 90&#x2032; and includes a 40&#x2032; wide sidewalk/parkway, 19&#x2032; curb lane, 4
full-time through lanes, all-day parking, and I median/left turn lane.	Note:
certain Community Plans and Specific Plans within the City of Los Angeles have
established modified designations and/or standards for some specific highways or
highway segments.	Utility Pole: A utility pole is defined as any pole which is
used to support power, telephone, or other suspended telecommunications wires,
and shall not include monopoles or antennas.	II.	General Restrictions:	A.	Below
Grade Requirement: All AGFs shall be installed below surrounding grade in each
of the following areas:	1.	City Planning Specific Plans (SP) as defined in LAMC
Sec. 11.5.7 unless specifically exempted by the Board of Public
Works.	2.	Historical Preservation Overlay Zones (HPOZ) as defined in LAMC Sec.
12.20.3.	3.	Areas adjoining sites that have been designated as having historic
significance. Historic sites are those identified as ZI 145-XXXX on the City of
Los Angeles Zoning Map.	4.	Areas adjoining Open Space (OS) Zones as defined in
LAMC Sec. 12.04.05.	5.	Along Scenic Highways as designated in the Transportation
Element of the General Plan as developed by the City of Los Angeles City
Planning Department.	6.	Pedestrian Oriented Districts (POD) as defined in LAMC
Section 13.07.	7.	Community Design Overlay Districts (CDO) as defined in LAMC
Section 13.08.	8.	Areas that have been designated by the Board of Public Works,
upon the recommendation of the City Council, as &#x201C;underground AGF areas.&#x201D;&#xA0;
The Board of Public Works may make this designation only in areas where all
existing AGFs, as defined in Parts I. and IX.C, are currently underground or are
required to be installed underground by law or contract.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No.
175,366, Eff. 9/1/03.)	B.	Hardship Waiver: The provisions of Section II.A
requiring installation of AGFs below grade may only be waived if the Board of
Public Works finds that hardship would result from the imposition of these
requirements. Hardship occurs when placing the AGF below grade is technically or
financially infeasible and all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted. The
Bureau of Engineering shall process an application for a hardship waiver within
45 days of submission. The 45-day process deadline shall commence when BOE
verifies the application is accurate and complete.	If the proposed AGF is
located within an applicable SP, HPOZ, POD, or CDO, the applicant shall first
submit an application to the City of Los Angeles Planning Department for
approval. The Planning Department approval shall be based on the recommendations
of the appropriate Design Review Board or HPOZ Board and must be obtained prior
to submittal of the hardship waiver request to the Bureau of Engineering (BOE).

commercial or manufacturing zone, C2, C4, C5, CM, MR1, M1, MR2, M2, and M3, as
defined by LAMC Sections 12.14, 12.16, 12.17, 12.17.1, 12.17.5, 12.17.6, 12.18,
12.19, and 12.20, respectively. At least two private property alternatives must
be documented to satisfy this requirement.	4.	A map prepared by the applicant
indicating the service area for the proposed AGF, which demonstrates that no
less than 50% of the AGFs benefit shall be specifically intended to service
customers in the restricted area.	5.	A statement by BOE Staff that the applicant
has completed all other requirements of the AGFSP, including copies of any
reports or comments from the Planning Department.	D.	Above Ground Allowance: The
AGF may be located above surrounding grade in the public rights of way in all
locations not falling under the restrictions of Section II.A. All AGF
applications for locations outside the restricted areas shall be subject to all
other applicable requirements of the AGFSP.	III.	Permit Requirements for AGF
Installations:	A.	Requirements for Utilities: All excavations in and adjacent to
streets require a excavation permit per LAMC Sec. 62.02.&#xA0; Entities that have
the authority to occupy the public rights-of-way by virtue of a state granted
certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity shall comply with the AGFSP and
obtain a Utility Permit to install an AGF. Compliance with the AGFSP and
approval of the Utility Permit are required prior to the start of any AGF
installation work.	B.	Requirements for Non-utilities:&#xA0; Entities that do not
have the state authority to occupy the public rights-of-way, shall comply with
the AGFSP and obtain a Revocable Permit and Excavation Permit to install an AGF.
Compliance with the AGFSP and approval of the Revocable and Excavation Permit
are required prior to the start of any AGF installation work.	C.	AGF
Installation Requirements: An applicant may apply for one to ten AGF
installation permits per Utility, Revocable, and/or Excavation Permit
application. The Bureau of Engineering shall process the first AGF permit
request within 30 days of submission, and may take up to two additional days for
each additional AGF permit request submitted as part of the application. The 30
day deadline shall commence when BOE verifies the permit request is accurate and
complete. The review period may be extended as necessary if the permit

V.E.	IV.	Permit Fees:	A.	Deposit: A deposit in the amount of $1,000 per AGF
installation permit shall be made by the applicant to cover the cost of
processing AGF permits prior to the start of permit processing. BOE staff shall
create a Work Order and credit the deposit amount to the Work Order. If charges
by BOE Staff exceed the deposit amount, the applicant shall deposit additional
funds to continue permit processing.	B.	Hardship Waiver Deposit: Due to the
additional time and effort required to review a hardship waiver request, an
additional $1,000 deposit shall be submitted for each hardship
waiver.	C.	Charges: City staff time used to process permit applications
containing AGF installations, variance requests, and AGF mapping shall be
charged to the AGF applicant Work Order.Specifications	V.	Aesthetic
Requirements:	A.	Visual Impact: The applicant shall demonstrate that the AGF
installation site meets the aesthetic requirements of the AGFSP. The AGF
installation should not obstruct street scape views, view corridors existing in
the public rights-of-way, view corridors of neighboring lots, or view corridors
from the public rights-of-way.	B.	AGF Volume Threshold: The AGF shall have a
maximum volume threshold of thirty-six (36) cubic feet. The AGF volume shall
include the combined volume of all cabinet enclosures that share a common
foundation or platform. The AGF volume shall not include the volume of the
foundation or platform supporting the cabinet that is above the existing
surrounding grade. The maximum AGF height shall be five and one-half feet (5&#x2032;
6&amp;&#x2033;). The minimum AGF height shall be two and one half feet (2&#x2032;
6&amp;&#x2033;). The Board of Public Works may grant a variance from the AGF volume
and height limitation if all of the following conditions exist:	1.	Suitable
measures consistent with the aesthetic guidelines of this report mitigate the
excessive AGF volume.	2.	The applicant demonstrates that no financially or
technically acceptable alternative exists that complies with Section V.B.	3.	The
cabinet design has been approved by the Cultural Affairs Commission.	BOE shall
prepare a Variance Board Report for consideration of the applicant s variance
request by the Board of Public Works. The Bureau of Engineering shall process
the initial variance request within 35 days of submission. The 35-day deadline
shall commence when BOE verifies the variance request to be accurate and
complete. In cases where multiple variances are requested, the BOE make take up
to five additional days for each additional variance request.	C.	Parkway
Alignment: The AGF should be placed in proximity to and in line with existing
power poles, street light fixtures, street signs and other structures within the
parkway to create an aesthetic and unobstructed alignment. The AGF shall not be
placed in such an alignment if the installation blocks the line of sight for
vehicles exiting adjacent alley intersections or driveways.	D.	Landscape
Considerations: For AGFs installed in a parkway, the AGF owner shall install
landscaping immediately surrounding the installation or restore any landscaping
disturbed by the installation. The installed or restored landscaping shall be
consistent with the existing landscaping in the parkway. For AGFs installed in
the public rights-of-way in an area where no sidewalk exists, the AGF owner
shall install landscaping immediately surrounding the installation and restore
any landscaping disturbed by the installation. The installed or restored
landscaping shall be consistent with the existing surrounding landscaping. All
new landscaping shall be installed and maintained for the purpose of screening
or camouflaging the AGF, and to create an aesthetically pleasing appearance. An

are less than 1000 feet apart, the threshold is three (3).	2.	For city blocks in
which the two adjacent intersections are equal to or greater than 1000 feet
apart, the threshold is three (3), plus a maximum of one (1) additional AGF for
every additional 250 feet of adjacent intersection separation.	3.	In Parking
zones (LAMC 12.12.1) and Industrial zones (LAMC 12.17.5 &#x2013; 12.20), there is no
AGF threshold per city block.	All facilities exempt from the AGFSP shall not be
counted in the number of AGF installations per city block. The Board of Public
Works may grant a variance from the AGF density threshold per city block at its
discretion when the threshold is reached and when measures consistent with the
AGFSP mitigate the excessive number of AGF installations. AGF co-location may be
required as a mitigation measure. The BOE shall prepare a Variance Board Report
for consideration of the applicant s variance request by the Board of Public
Works. The Bureau of Engineering shall process the initial variance request
within 35 days of submission and, in cases where multiple variances are
