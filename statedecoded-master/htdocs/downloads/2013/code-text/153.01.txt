DECLARATION OF PURPOSE. (§ 153.01)

  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,074, Eff. 6/23/96.)	On March 6, 1996, the Council of the
City of Los Angeles adopted recommendations from the Housing and Community
Redevelopment Committee to establish the Habitability Enforcement Program
(“HEP”) substantially in conformance with the definitions and procedures
outlined in a February 14, 1996 Department report.	As stated in that report,
“HEP is built on the existing Rent Reduction and REAP programs.  It is
principally distinguished from the existing programs [because a] complaint
alleging [a] habitability violation can be initiated by the tenant
.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. [and it] allows a rent reduction and rent escrow order to be
imposed in a much shorter time frame .&thinsp;.&thinsp;. ”	HEP is a pilot
program to be reviewed at the end of 18 months.  During this 18 month period
the Department will report to the Mayor and City Council and the Department,
Department of Building and Safety, and the Fire Department will report to the
Public Safety Committee on a quarterly basis on the progress of the pilot
program and any recommendations for revisions to HEP.
