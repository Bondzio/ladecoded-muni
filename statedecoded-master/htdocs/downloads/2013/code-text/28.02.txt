HAND-BILLS – PERMISSION PREMISES. (§ 28.02)

  HAND-BILLS – PERMISSION PREMISES.	No person shall distribute, deposit,
throw, place or attach any hand-bill to, in or upon any porch, yard, steps or
mail-box located upon any premises not in the possession of or under the control
of the person distributing the said hand-bill, which premises has posted thereon
in a conspicuous place, a sign of at least twelve inches in area bearing the
works, “No Advertising,” unless the person distributing the hand-bills has
first received the written permission of the person occupying or having
possession of such premises authorizing him so to do.	Advertising is a lawful
occupation and as such is a property right secured by the constitutional
guarantees against deprivation of property without due process of law, however
such occupation may be regulated by forbidding its distribution in places where
it might result in the littering of public places.
