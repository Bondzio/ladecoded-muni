INDOOR WATER USE. (§ 99.09.303)

  INDOOR WATER USE.99.09.303.1.  Water Use Reduction.  New plumbing fixtures
and fittings shall not exceed maximum allowable flow rate specified in Table
9.303.2.99.09.303.2.  Multiple Showerheads Serving One Shower.  When single
shower fixtures are served by more than one showerhead, the combined flow rate
of all the showerheads shall not exceed the maximum flow rates specified in the
maximum allowable flow rate column contained in Table 9.303.2 or the shower
shall be designed to only allow one showerhead to be in operation at a
time.	EXCEPTION:  When a calculation demonstrating a 20 percent reduction in
the building “water use” baseline as established in Table 9.303.1 is
provided, the maximum flow rate may be increased to 2.5 gpm @ 80 psi.  The
calculation shall be limited to the following plumbing fixture and fitting
types: water closets, urinals, lavatory faucets, and showerheads.TABLE 9.303.1
