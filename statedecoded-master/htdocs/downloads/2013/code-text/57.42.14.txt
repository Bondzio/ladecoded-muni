INSTALLATION OF ABOVEGROUND CONTAINERS. (§ 57.42.14)

  INSTALLATION OF ABOVEGROUND CONTAINERS.	A.	Containers installed aboveground
shall be provided with substantial masonry or noncombustible structural supports
so installed as to prevent accidental movement.	B.	Structural members providing
vertical support for tanks having a capacity exceeding 600 gallons shall be
protected as set forth in Chapter 9 of the L.A.M.C. (Building
Code).	C.	Horizontal, aboveground storage containers shall be mounted on saddles
in such a manner as to permit expansion and contraction, not only of the
container but also of the connected piping. Only two such saddles shall be used
and every container shall be supported to prevent the concentration of excessive
loads on the supporting portion of the shell.
