hole setups onshore, cables may be buried in the earth or run in covered, wooden troughs between outdoor units of equipment.\u00a0 A substantial, nominal 2-inch thick wooden cover or equivalent, shall be installed over the trough.\n\n\t(g)\tLighting.\u00a0 Lighting systems for oil or gas well drilling rigs, production hoists, derricks or masts shall be permitted to be wired using an approved prefabricated assembly of flexible cables with vulcanized, molded or other approved terminating receptacle devices so designed that electric arcs will be confined within the receptacle enclosure which

locations:\tA.\tBelow-grade well cellars.\u00a0 See Figures 7 and 9.\tB.\tEnclosed areas such as, wellhead, compressor or pump rooms where volatile, flammable liquids or gases may be present in concentrations sufficient to render the area a hazardous location.\tNOTE:\u00a0 See Figures 8 through 10.\tEXCEPTIONS:\t1.\tAdequately ventilated enclosed areas shall be permitted to be classified as Class I, Division 2 locations.\tNOTE:\u00a0 See Figure 7.\t2.\t(Over 600 volts, nominal):\u00a0 In case of producing oil wells, the Division 2 classification shall include an area within three feet of the well casing to a height of three feet around the stuffing box or lubricator, and the area extending ten feet from the well casing to a height of 18 inches above the grade level of all producing oil wells (pumped, flowing or gas injected) having a gas pressure sufficient to cause gas to be liberated to the atmosphere in quantities to create a hazard to employees should liberated gas become ignited.\u00a0 Producing gas wells shall have a similar classified area.\t2.\tClass I, Division 2 Locations.\u00a0 The following areas shall be classified as Class I, Division 2 locations:\tA.\tWithin ten feet horizontally and 18 inches vertically from the well casing and three feet radially from the stuffing box of all producing wells equipped with beam pumping units.\tNOTE:\u00a0 See Figures 8 and 9.\tB.\tWithin ten feet horizontally and 18 inches vertically above grade from the edge of well cellars or other below grade Class I, Division I locations.\tC.\tWithin ten feet horizontally and vertically from openings in enclosed areas classified as Class I, Division I locations in Subdivision (d) 1. above.\tNOTE:\u00a0 See Figures 3, 5 and 10.\t3.\tClass I, Division 1 and 2.\u00a0 Areas within a 10-foot radius of oil field auxiliary equipment such as gas vents, oil-gas separator vessels, tanks, pumps, compressors and similar equipment shall be classified in accordance with Figures 11 through 19.\t(e)\tOverload Protection.\u00a0 No overload protection will be required for drilling rigs using railroad locomotive power systems for the draw works, rotary tables and mud pumps.\tNOTE:\u00a0 In this electrical system, generators, generator power leads, and DC motors are automatically protected against overload by inherent characteristics of compound and differential field windings in the DC motor and generator, respectively.\t(f)\tWiring Methods.\t1.\tGeneral.\u00a0 Where drilling platforms are not enclosed around the drilling operation, all wiring and equipment within 25 feet of the casing of the well being drilled shall be of the type required for Class I, Division 2 locations, or be installed in enclosed areas supplied with adequate ventilation.\u00a0 The electrical power supply to wiring and equipment within positive pressure ventilated areas shall be arranged to prevent energizing the electrical wiring and apparatus until air pressure has been established, for not less than two minutes, and arranged to automatically actuate an audible and visual alarm with a 5-minute shutdown time delay to allow safe operational shutdown prior to de-energizing the wiring and apparatus when the ventilation fails.\tEnclosed areas supplied with positive pressure ventilation from a nonhazardous area shall be permitted to be classified as nonhazardous areas, provided no flammable vapor source exists within the enclosed areas.\t2.\tLocomotive Type Cables.\u00a0 Special locomotive cables and other equivalent portable cables may be run in cable trays under the following conditions in all locations:\tA.\tOpen cable trays may be run horizontally under floors or ceilings.\tB.\tIn all locations, solid covers shall be installed on horizontal runs where persons or materials may accidentally contact the conductors.\tC.\tVertical runs of trays shall be totally enclosed.\tD.\tWhere the rig moves over a series of well holes and a transverse section of cable tray drops trailing cables in a long fixed runway tray, cleats or other means shall be used to secure the cable against shifting in the moving section of the tray.\tE.\tFor single hole setups onshore, cables may be buried in the earth or run in covered, wooden troughs between outdoor units of equipment.\u00a0 A substantial, nominal 2-inch thick wooden cover or equivalent, shall be installed over the trough.\t(g)\tLighting.\u00a0 Lighting systems for oil or gas well drilling rigs, production hoists, derricks or masts shall be permitted to be wired using an approved prefabricated assembly of flexible cables with vulcanized, molded or other approved terminating receptacle devices so designed that electric arcs will be confined within the receptacle enclosure which shall be the concealed contact-type.\u00a0 The lighting fixture shall be of the type permitted for Class I, Division I locations, or of the enclosed gasketed-type.\u00a0 These assemblies shall be securely fastened to the drilling rig or hoist structure and so located that they will be protected from physical damage.(Figures 1 \u2013 19 Inclusive, Relocated from Division 11
