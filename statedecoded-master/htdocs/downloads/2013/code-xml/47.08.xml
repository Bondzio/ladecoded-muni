	a.	Management shall pay a fee to the City so that a Relocation Assistance Service Provider will:

	(1)	Make available to each tenant, at no cost, a reasonably complete and current list of vacant and available rental units, which are comparable as to size and amenities to the unit occupied by the tenant, and

	(2)	Make a reasonable and good faith effort to assure that tenants without cars are driven, at no cost, and tenants with cars are assisted, in order to inspect replacement rental units, and

	(3)	Hire an ambulance or similar vehicle, at no cost to the tenant, and otherwise take reasonable steps to assist any disabled or handicapped tenant with relocation-related activities.

	b.	In order to assist the tenants in meeting costs of relocation, higher rents for replacement housing, and any related expenses, pay a relocation fee in the following amounts.&#xA0; If more than one fee applies to a rental unit, pay the highest of the applicable fees:

	(1)	$15,300 to qualified tenants and a $7,000 fee to all other tenants who have lived in their rental unit for fewer than three years; or

	(2)	$17,600 to qualified tenants and a $9,300 fee to all other tenants who have lived in their rental unit for three years or longer; or

	(3)	$17,600 to qualified tenants and $9,300 to all other tenants whose household income is 80 percent or below Area Median Income (AMI), as adjusted for household size, as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development regardless of length of tenancy.&#xA0; Tenants who claim eligibility pursuant to this subparagraph shall file a statement with the Housing Department verifying their income on a form prescribed by the Housing Department.&#xA0; The Housing Department shall charge a fee of $186 per rental unit to resolve any disputes regarding tenant income eligibility.

	For the year beginning July 1, 2009, and all subsequent years, the fee amounts shall be adjusted on an annual basis pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 151.06 D. of this Code.&#xA0; The adjusted amount shall be rounded to the nearest $50 increment.

	c.	The relocation fee provided for in Paragraph b. above, shall be made as follows:

	(1)	The entire fee shall be paid to a tenant who is the only tenant in a rental unit; and

	(2)	If a rental unit is occupied by two or more tenants, then each tenant of the unit shall be paid an equal, pro-rata share of the fee.

	In no event shall the landlord be liable to pay more than the maximum relocation amounts set forth above to all tenants residing in a rental unit.&#xA0; If a tenant is entitled to monetary relocation benefits pursuant to City administrative agency action or any provision of local, state or federal law, then those benefits shall operate as a credit against any fee required to be paid to the tenant under this section.

	2.	When Assistance Shall Be Provided.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 180,071, Eff. 8/30/08.)

	a.	Payment for Relocation Assistance Service Provider.&#xA0; Management shall perform the acts described in Paragraph a. of Subdivision 1. above on or before the service of the Notice to Quit.

	b.	Monetary Assistance.&#xA0; Management shall perform the acts described in Paragraph b. of Subdivision 1. above within 15 days of service of the Notice to Quit.

	E.	Affirmative Defense.&#xA0; In an action by management to recover possession of a space occupied by a mobilehome or to recover possession of a mobilehome, as the case may be, the defendant may raise as an affirmative defense the failure of management to provide relocation assistance as required by this section.

	F.	(Repealed by Ord. No. 180,071, Eff. 8/30/08.)

	G.	Notification to City. (Added by Ord. No. 154,073, Eff. 7/28/80.)

	1.	The management shall serve, by personal service or by United States Mail, written notice on the Superintendent of Building of the proposed termination of mobilehome park use, accompanied by such information and in a form designated for such purpose by the Superintendent. Upon publication of this subsection in the newspaper, the Superintendent shall forthwith notify the management of all mobilehome parks within the City limits of the requirements of this subsection.

	a.	Where the Notice to Quit is served on or after the effective date of this subsection, the notice to the Superintendent shall be served on or before the 30th day prior to the expiration of one period stated in the Notice to Quit.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 157,153*, Eff. 10/15/82.)

	b.	Where the Notice to Quit is served prior to the effective date of this subsection, the notice to the Superintendent shall be served on or before the 10th day prior to the expiration of the period stated in the Notice to Quit.

	2.	The notice referred to in Subdivision 1 above shall be accompanied by a statement that the management has provided all relocation assistance required by law, accompanied with proof of such assistance in the form of notarized signed acknowledgments from the recipients thereof or a notarized sign waiver of assistance.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 157,153*, Eff. 10/15/82.)

	3.	If management fails to substantially comply with this Subsection G, as determined by the Superintendent of Building, the Superintendent shall forthwith notify the Director of Planning and all other appropriate City departments and officials of such noncompliance. These departments and officials shall not issue, grant or approve any application or request for any permit, license or other entitlement of use (including but not limited to a building permit, conditional use permit, zone change, variance, certificate of occupancy, tract or parcel map) for any change of use.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 157,153, Eff. 10/15/82.)

	4.	This Subsection G shall apply only to those mobilehome parks at which resides a tenant or a resident who is subject to a Notice to Quit which specifies a period which terminates on or after July 1, 1980. The requirement of notarized signed acknowledgments set forth in Subdivision 2 above shall not apply as to any recipient of relocation assistance who vacated the mobilehome park prior to July 27, 1980.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 162,743, Eff. 9/24/87.)

	* The amendments to Section 47.08 of this Code set forth in this ordinance shall apply to any action to recover possession of a rental unit which has not become final as of the effective date of this ordinance.</full_text><order_by>08</order_by><ancestry><unit id="40" label="article"><name>Miscellaneous</name><identifier>7</identifier><url>/4/7/</url></unit><unit id="11" label="chapter"><name>Public Welfare</name><identifier>4</identifier><url>/4/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="2460"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.00</section_number><catch_line>Posting Of Telephone Number Of The Fire Department Emergency Ambulance Service In Eating Establishments.</catch_line><url>/47.00/</url><token>47.00</token></unit><unit id="3540"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.01</section_number><catch_line>Hotels, Motels, Lodging And Rooming Houses &#x2013; Register Required.</catch_line><url>/47.01/</url><token>47.01</token></unit><unit id="823"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.02</section_number><catch_line>Marathons &#x2013; Endurance Contests And Exhibitions.</catch_line><url>/47.02/</url><token>47.02</token></unit><unit id="4149"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.03</section_number><catch_line>Political Solicitations From City Officers And Employees.</catch_line><url>/47.03/</url><token>47.03</token></unit><unit id="3741"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.04</section_number><catch_line>Sale Of Used Or Secondhand Hats.</catch_line><url>/47.04/</url><token>47.04</token></unit><unit id="2431"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.05</section_number><catch_line>New Locks In Apartments &#x2013; Installation Required.</catch_line><url>/47.05/</url><token>47.05</token></unit><unit id="2668"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.06</section_number><catch_line>Tenant Relocation Assistance Where Apartments Are To Be Converted.</catch_line><url>/47.06/</url><token>47.06</token></unit><unit id="4136"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.07</section_number><catch_line>Tenant Relocation Assistance Where Apartments Are To Be Demolished.</catch_line><url>/47.07/</url><token>47.07</token></unit><unit id="276"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.08</section_number><catch_line>Tenant Relocation Assistance Where Mobilehome Parks Are Changed To A Different Use.</catch_line><url>/47.08/</url><token>47.08</token></unit><unit id="1243"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.09</section_number><catch_line>Mobilehome Park Closure Impact Report.</catch_line><url>/47.09/</url><token>47.09</token></unit><unit id="1478"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.10</section_number><catch_line>Landlords &#x2013; Nonpayment Of Utility Bills.</catch_line><url>/47.10/</url><token>47.10</token></unit><unit id="3579"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.11</section_number><catch_line>Display Of Aerosol Spray Paint Containers And Marker Pens.</catch_line><url>/47.11/</url><token>47.11</token></unit><unit id="2250"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.12</section_number><catch_line>Excessive Price Increases During State Of Emergency.</catch_line><url>/47.12/</url><token>47.12</token></unit><unit id="782"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.13</section_number><catch_line>Insertion Of Writings Into Containers.</catch_line><url>/47.13/</url><token>47.13</token></unit><unit id="70"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.14</section_number><catch_line>Self Service Display Of Tobacco Products.</catch_line><url>/47.14/</url><token>47.14</token></unit><unit id="408"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.15</section_number><catch_line>Spectators Prohibited At Speed Contests And Exhibitions Of Speed.</catch_line><url>/47.15/</url><token>47.15</token></unit><unit id="1944"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.16</section_number><catch_line>Display And Sale Of Glass Etching Products.</catch_line><url>/47.16/</url><token>47.16</token></unit><unit id="803"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.17</section_number><catch_line>Sale Of Motor-Driven Cycles And Motorized Bicycles.</catch_line><url>/47.17/</url><token>47.17</token></unit><unit id="3415"><structure_id>40</structure_id><section_number>47.50</section_number><catch_line>Narcotics, Violent Crime, Unlawful Weapon Or Ammunition

made as follows:	(1)	The entire fee shall be paid to a tenant who is the only
tenant in a rental unit; and	(2)	If a rental unit is occupied by two or more
tenants, then each tenant of the unit shall be paid an equal, pro-rata share of
the fee.	In no event shall the landlord be liable to pay more than the maximum
relocation amounts set forth above to all tenants residing in a rental unit.&#xA0;
If a tenant is entitled to monetary relocation benefits pursuant to City
administrative agency action or any provision of local, state or federal law,
then those benefits shall operate as a credit against any fee required to be
paid to the tenant under this section.	2.	When Assistance Shall Be Provided.&#xA0;

section.	F.	(Repealed by Ord. No. 180,071, Eff. 8/30/08.)	G.	Notification to
City. (Added by Ord. No. 154,073, Eff. 7/28/80.)	1.	The management shall serve,

Superintendent shall forthwith notify the management of all mobilehome parks
within the City limits of the requirements of this subsection.	a.	Where the
Notice to Quit is served on or after the effective date of this subsection, the
notice to the Superintendent shall be served on or before the 30th day prior to
the expiration of one period stated in the Notice to Quit.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord.
No. 157,153*, Eff. 10/15/82.)	b.	Where the Notice to Quit is served prior to the
effective date of this subsection, the notice to the Superintendent shall be

G, as determined by the Superintendent of Building, the Superintendent shall
forthwith notify the Director of Planning and all other appropriate City
departments and officials of such noncompliance. These departments and officials
shall not issue, grant or approve any application or request for any permit,
