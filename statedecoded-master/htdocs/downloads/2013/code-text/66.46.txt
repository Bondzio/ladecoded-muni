UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. (§ 66.46)

  UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,293, Eff. 6/30/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)	If the Director of
Finance finds that he or she cannot collect the charges and penalty imposed
under this article, or either of them, or that efforts to collect any such
amount would be disproportionately costly with relation to the probable outcome
of the collection efforts, the Director of Finance may prepare a report setting
forth his or her finding and the reasons therefor, and submit it to a Board of
Review which shall be composed of the City Controller, the Director of Finance
and the City Attorney, or the duly appointed representative of each. The Board
of Review may call for additional evidence which it may deem relevant. Upon
unanimous approval of a finding by the Board of Review, the Director of Finance
may remove from his or her active accounts receivable said unpaid charges and
penalty, or either of them. If the Board of Review does not unanimously
recommend approval of the finding, the matter shall be returned to the Director
of Finance. The Director of Finance may include in a single report his or her
findings and supporting reasons regarding the charges and penalty imposed under
this article, or either of them, due from more than one customer. The removal
from the active accounts receivable of the Director of Finance of any unpaid
charges and penalty imposed under this article, or either of them, shall not
preclude the City from collecting or attempting to collect any such charges and
penalty, or either of them.
