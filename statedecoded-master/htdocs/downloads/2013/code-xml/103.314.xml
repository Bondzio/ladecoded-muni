expires.	(t)	(Subsec. (s) Redesignated as (t) by Ord. No. 180,451, Eff.
2/7/09.)&#xA0; If any provision of this ordinance is found to be unconstitutional or
otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, that invalidity shall
not affect the remaining provisions, which can be implemented without the
invalid provisions, and to this end, the provisions of this ordinance are
declared to be severable.
