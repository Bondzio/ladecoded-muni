EXTENSIONS. (§ 161.704.3)

  EXTENSIONS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 173,011, Eff. 1/30/00.)	If the violation has not been
corrected by the compliance date but significant progress has been completed,
the inspector may grant a single extension of time, not to exceed 30 days.  If
upon subsequent reinspection the violation has not been corrected but
significant additional progress has been completed since the previous
inspection, the inspector’s supervisor may grant a single additional extension
of time, not to exceed 30 days.  Any other or further extensions of time may be
granted only by the General Manager or his or her designee.  The extensions
permitted by this section are not automatic.  In determining whether to grant
any extension, the Department shall consider the criteria set forth in Section
161.602.1 and any other criteria set forth by regulation indicating a risk of
recurring violations.
