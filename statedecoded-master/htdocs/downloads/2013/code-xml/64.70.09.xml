	In addition to any fine or penalty imposed, whenever any discharger introduces or causes the introduction of non-storm water or any pollutant in violation of this article and the discharge results in a violation of any State or Federal laws or regulations, damages public property, or adversely affects a storm drain system in the City of Los Angeles or receiving waters, the discharge shall be deemed a public nuisance and the discharger shall be liable to the City for reasonable costs necessary to correct that discharge, detriment or adverse effect, including, but not limited to labor, material, inspection, transportation, overhead, and incidental expenses associated with the corrective action or the clean-up of the pollutant and its effects.

	All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall be a personal obligation against the discharger and any owner of any property that is the source of any discharge, recoverable by the City in an
