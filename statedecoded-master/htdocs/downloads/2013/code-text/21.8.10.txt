REFUNDS. (§ 21.8.10)

  REFUNDS.	(a)	Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more
than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City
under this article it may be refunded as provided in this section. Except as
otherwise provided in this section, refunds of overpaid taxes shall be made in
the same manner as is provided in Sec. 21.07 of this chapter for refunds of
overpayments in Business Taxes.	(b)	A retailer may claim a refund or take as
credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in
a manner prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax
has been collected was not a user or consumer as that term is defined in
Subsection (b) of Sec. 21.8.1; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the purchaser erroneously required to pay the tax or otherwise
credited to him.	(c)	No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this
section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records
showing entitlement thereto.
