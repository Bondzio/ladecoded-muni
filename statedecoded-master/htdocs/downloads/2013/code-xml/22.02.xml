	Any permit or certificate granted pursuant to the provisions of this Code to any person to conduct, carry on or engage In any business, profession, trade or occupation by any Board, Commission or other person having authority to do so, unless provision is otherwise specifically made, shall not be revoked or suspended except as provided in this section.

	No such permit or certificate shall be revoked or suspended until a hearing upon written notice to the permittee or certificate holder shall have been had by the Board, Commission or other person having authority to do so. Written notice of such hearing shall be served upon the permittee or certificate holder in the manner provided for the giving of notice in Section 11.00 of this Code.

	Such notice shall state:

	(a)	The grounds for complaint or reasons for the revocation or suspension in clear and concise language.

	(b)	The time when and the place where such hearing is to be held.

	If a verified complaint is required to be filed with the Board, Commission or other person having authority to revoke or suspend such permit or certificate, or if any Board or Commission shall have power to initiate its own complaint, then a true and correct copy of such complaint shall be served on the permittee or certificate holder in lieu of stating the grounds of complaint. However, notice of the time when and the place where such hearing is to be held shall be served with such complaint.

	Such notice or copy of complaint shall be served or given to the permittee or certificate holder at least five (5) and not more than ten (10) days prior to the date set for said hearing.

	At any such hearing the permittee or certificate holder shall be given an opportunity to be heard and defend himself, and he may call witnesses in his behalf.

	The Board, Commission or other person conducting such hearings may continue such hearings from time to time upon good cause being shown therefor.

	After conducting such hearing the Board, Commission or other person having authority may suspend or revoke any such permit or certificate upon such terms and conditions as, in the exercise of a reasonable and sound discretion, it shall determine.

	Revocation of permit granted by it by a municipal board is a proper exercise of police power.
