SOLID WASTE FACILITY APPLICATION PERMIT REVIEW FEES. (§ 192.02)

  SOLID WASTE FACILITY APPLICATION PERMIT REVIEW FEES.	A.	All proposed solid
waste facilities must submit permit review fees, as set forth in Sec. 193.02.12
of this Code at the time that the application for a permit for a solid waste
facility is submitted to the Department.	B.	The review fee will be based on the
time and materials cost associated with processing the application.  If more
than 100 hours of staff time are needed to complete the application review
process, the applicant will be billed by the Department monthly to cover these
costs.  These costs will include costs for staff time utilized and the cost of
City contracted consulting services plus a 10% administrative fee.	1.	In
determining the appropriate type of permit for existing solid waste facilities
permit revisions and/or proposed facilities applications, facilities with
multiple types of waste processing operations (e.g., transfer operations,
greenwaste processing, recycling, etc.) on a single site shall be classified,
for the purpose of the permitting requirements, according to the most
restrictive permit classification.  The applicable fee schedule for the most
restrictive permit classification applies.	2.	For single sites with multiple
operations, the permitting requirements of each of the individual operations
must be met in addition to the overall permitting requirements of the most
restrictive operation that determines the appropriate permit type.
