DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PORTABLE TANKS. (§ 57.30.55)

  DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PORTABLE TANKS.	A.	No person shall construct,
sell, operate, use, or maintain any portable tank unless a General Approval for
the type, design, and construction has been granted by the Department in
accordance with L.A.F.D. Standards No. 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 or the tank is
constructed in accordance with nationally recognized standards as required by
Division 5 of this article.	B.	Each portable tank shall be provided with one or
more devices installed in the top with sufficient emergency venting capacity to
limit internal pressure under fire exposure conditions to 10 PSIG or 30 percent
of the bursting pressure of the tank, whichever is greater. At least one
pressure-actuated vent having a minimum capacity of 6,000 cubic feet of free air
per hour (at 14.7 PSIA and 60°F.) shall be used. It shall be set to open at not
less than 5 PSIG. If fusible vents are used, they shall be actuated by elements
that operate at a temperature not exceeding 300°F. When used for paints, drying
oils, and similar materials, where plugging of the pressure-actuated vent can
occur, fusible vents or vents of the type that soften to failure at a maximum of
300° under fire exposure may be used for the entire emergency venting
requirement.	C.	All pipe connections, valves, and fittings shall be installed in
accordance with Division 39 of this article.
