Board.\n\n\tNo permit shall be required under this section if the person engaged in the operation of the arcade has a valid carnival permit issued under the provisions of Division 7 of Chapter 10 of this Code in which a picture arcade is permitted.\n\n\t(b)\tNotwithstanding any other provision and specifically the provisions of Sections 12.26 A.2., 102.02(d), 102.15 and 102.17, the following provisions apply to picture arcades and adult picture arcades.\n\n\t(1)\tApplication.\u00a0 An application for a picture arcade or an adult picture arcade permit shall be filed in person only at the

section shall be returned within 30 days with a date stamp of the date of return and be accompanied by a written statement specifying the reasons for the return.\u00a0 Any refiled application shall also be processed within 30 days.\u00a0 If there is no final, judicially reviewable decision within 30 days, the permit shall be deemed granted except that any period during which a hearing or a decision on a hearing is pending shall not count toward the 30 days.\n\n\t(2)\tBuilding and Safety Verification.\u00a0 An application for a picture arcade or adult picture arcade shall include proof that a request was filed with the Department of Building and Safety for verification that the proposed use is permitted: 1) in the zone where the site is located and 2) by the certificate of occupancy.\u00a0 The request for verification shall be filed at the Zoning Counter located at the downtown office of the Department of Building and Safety.\u00a0 Any response to the request for verification shall be included with the application.\u00a0 A permit for a picture arcade or adult picture arcade shall not be denied based upon the applicant\u2019s failure to obtain verification if the Department of Building and Safety has not responded to the request within the 30 day permit application processing period.\n\n\t(3)\tDenial of Application.\u00a0 Prior to denial of the permit, the applicant shall be given written notice of the intention to deny the permit.\u00a0 The Board may deny the permit upon any of the grounds expressly set forth in 103.31(b), or any other zoning-related grounds.\u00a0 A request for hearing on the intention to deny may be filed pursuant to Section 103.33.\u00a0 The hearing may be continued for up to 30 days by the applicant.\u00a0 Any denial of the permit shall set forth all bases for denying the permit.\u00a0 Additional bases may not be added to the denial following remand by a court or upon reconsideration.\u00a0 Any decision denying the permit shall be a final decision.\n\n\t(4)\tSuspension or Revocation for violation of Section 103.34.1 4.\u00a0 The Police Department shall provide written notice to the on-premises manager or permittee of conduct that violates Section 103.34.1 4.\u00a0 Notice may be given pursuant to Section 102.02(f).\u00a0 A suspension or revocation order may not be based upon 103.34.1 4, unless the Board makes an affirmative finding of actual knowledge that the conduct regularly occurred on the premises and that the permittee thereafter failed to take steps to prevent the conduct.\n\n\t(5)\tSuspension or Revocation based on Orders of Other Agencies or City Departments.\u00a0 Orders or determinations received from other agencies or City departments may be grounds for suspension or revocation only if they are final and in writing.\n\n\t(6)\tService of Order of Revocation or Suspension.\u00a0 An order revoking or suspending a permit for a picture arcade or an adult picture arcade shall be served by certified mail and shall be final upon service upon the permittee.\u00a0 The order shall not be enforced for a period of 35 days after the service.\n\n\t(7)\tReconsideration of Board Decision of Suspension or Revocation.\u00a0 The permittee may request reconsideration of the Board decision of suspension or revocation within ten days of service of the order in accordance with Section 103.33.\u00a0 If reconsideration is requested, enforcement of the decision shall be further deferred 35 days from the date of service of the
