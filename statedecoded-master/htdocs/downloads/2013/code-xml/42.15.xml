	B.	Findings and Purposes. The City Council of the City of Los Angeles finds and declares as follows:

	1.	The Boardwalk and Recreation Area constitute a major tourist attraction in the City, hosting approximately 16 million visitors annually. The Boardwalk and Recreation Area are limited spaces geographically, located in a narrow, linear City park that is bounded by the beach to the West and private property to the East. The total width of the Boardwalk is only ten feet in certain sections and only as wide as 50 feet in other limited areas. The space is further constrained by the fact the Boardwalk and Recreation Area serve as emergency ingress and egress routes.

	2.	Historically, visitors, including tourists, have been drawn to Venice beach because, the Boardwalk and Recreation Area served as a traditional public forum for performance and visual artists, as well as other free speech activity. Vendors of Food, Goods and Merchandise viewed the large crowds of visitors to the Boardwalk and Recreation Area as a pool of potential customers and Vending proliferated. As the numbers of commercial Vendors increased, the number of Performers and persons engaging in free speech activities decreased both because of the limited amount of space and because of the change in atmosphere from a vibrant center of art and expression to a commercial &#x201C;flea market&#x201D; atmosphere. Competing interests for space on the Boardwalk and Recreation Area intensified and physical altercations for space and disturbances of the peace resulted in law enforcement responses and arrests.

	3.	Unregulated Vending and Performances adversely affect the historic character of the Boardwalk, hamper rather than encourage a wide variety of performances, visual artists and other free speech activity, as well as jeopardize the public safety of visitors to the Boardwalk, resulting in an economic and cultural loss to the City. Therefore, the Boardwalk requires reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to retain its unique historic character as a center of performance, art, and other free speech activity, preserve its status as a tourist attraction, protect the commercial life of the Boardwalk, and ensure the safety and enjoyment of residents, visitors, advocates, artists, performers, and Vendors alike. Due to its unique historical, geographical, and physical characteristics, the Boardwalk requires its own set of rules and regulations different from other public parks in the City.

	4.	Unregulated Vending and Performing harms the Boardwalk, and therefore must be regulated because:

	(a)	Tourists are deterred from visiting or shopping at the Boardwalk as they are constantly approached, solicited, and sometimes harassed by unregulated Vendors and Performers. Regulation is therefore necessary to manage the time, place, and manner of Vending on the Boardwalk, in order to ensure that tourists are not deterred from visiting or shopping at the Boardwalk;

	(b)	The amount of space on the Boardwalk that is available for performing and visual artists and for political advocacy is limited due to the size of the Boardwalk and the large crowds of visitors that the Boardwalk attracts. Due to the limited amount of space, unregulated Vending along the Boardwalk prevents many Persons from engaging in performance, art, advocacy or other expressive activities. The lack of regulations for Vending, Performing and noise has resulted in conflicting claims for the available spaces. Numerous altercations occurred, in competition for locations and amounts of space, during time periods in which the City lacked regulations for noise and a system for allocating available space for Vending and Performing. Frequently, the altercations became violent requiring law enforcement response to preserve the public peace. Persons wishing to secure spaces often arrive prior to dawn and create loud noise in setting up their displays, thereby disturbing the public peace, including the peace of the residents on and near the Boardwalk, and requiring a law enforcement response. Unregulated, the Boardwalk became a place where only the strongest and earliest arrivals could secure space to exercise their rights of free expression without threat of intimidation. Regulation is necessary, therefore, to manage the use of the limited space on the Boardwalk to prevent conflicting claims for the space and to allocate the limited space available fairly to all who desire to use it for lawful purposes;

	(c)	Tables, Pushcarts, stands, and certain equipment of Vendors and Performers impede the orderly movement of pedestrian traffic along the narrow Boardwalk and may make the Boardwalk unsafe for pedestrians by limiting the City&#x2019;s ability to effect crowd management and control. Certain equipment of Vendors and Performers contributes to visual clutter and blight, especially when it impacts the ability of Boardwalk visitors to see the Pacific Ocean. Regulating the use of equipment by Vendors and Performers therefore is necessary to manage the orderly movement of pedestrian traffic. Regulation also is necessary to avoid injuries to pedestrians as well as ensure the existence of emergency and non-emergency ingress and egress between the beach and the Boardwalk;

	(d)	The Vendors, Performers and their equipment impede the ingress and egress of emergency and public safety vehicles by creating physical obstacles to emergency response and administration of aid to those in need of immediate medical attention and to victims of criminal activity. Regulation is therefore necessary to ensure that Vendors, Performers and their equipment do not interfere with emergency response vehicles that provide assistance to individuals with medical needs and victims of criminal activity;

	(e)	Unregulated Vending has resulted in the sale of stolen, defective or counterfeit merchandise. Regulation therefore is necessary to protect the public and the Boardwalk commercial life;

	(f)	Unregulated Vending of personal services has resulted in activities that are illegal and harmful to human health, including the offering of services by unlicensed Vendors of services for which a license is required by the State of California, physical assaults and the application of toxic chemicals to Persons;

	(g)	Unregulated Vending causes visual clutter/blight along the Boardwalk, impedes views of the beach and the Pacific Ocean, and threatens the City&#x2019;s ability to attract tourists and preserve businesses along the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is necessary to manage the number of Vendors, the size of their equipment and displays, and the location of Vending activity;

	(h)	Unregulated Vending creates unnecessary, excessive and annoying noise on the Boardwalk, is detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety and contrary to the public interest, harms residents, the commercial life of the Boardwalk and the historic character of the Boardwalk, and diminishes the quality of life for those who visit, live or work on or near the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is necessary to establish restrictions on noise at the Boardwalk; and

	(i)	The Recreation Area is a site that is uniquely suitable to and frequently used for events that require pre-planning and advanced notice. The Recreation Area is the location of the Police Substation where vehicles require the ability for unobstructed ingress and egress. Due to the size, shape, and physical attributes of the Recreation Area (including a skate park and plaza, paddle tennis courts and exercise equipment), it is also a site uniquely suitable to and used by many Persons for skateboarding, paddle tennis, and other sports and exercise. The Recreation Area is the home of historic &#x201C;Muscle Beach&#x201D;, a popular tourist attraction. Muscle Beach is world renowned as home of physical fitness advocates and body builders, including Jack La Lanne (considered to be the father of the modern fitness movement), Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbo and Dave Draper.

	C.	Beach Vending Prohibition. Except as specifically allowed in this Section, no Person shall engage in Vending upon any public beach lands or properties adjoining the waterfront of the Pacific Ocean, or upon any immediately adjacent Boardwalk, sidewalk or public way between the southerly boundary of the City of Santa Monica and the northerly boundary of the City of El Segundo and between the northwesterly boundary of the City of Santa Monica and the northwesterly boundary of the City of Los Angeles.

	D.	Vending and Performing on Designated Spaces. To address the findings and purposes set forth in this Section, the City has created reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on Vending and noise, as well as to facilitate Performing. To preserve the Boardwalk&#x2019;s rich history of fostering new artists, performance, and other free speech activity, the City has divided the available space on the Boardwalk into 205 areas, known as Designated Spaces, where:

	1.	Persons can engage in traditional expressive speech and petitioning activities, and can Vend the following expressive items: newspapers, leaflets, pamphlets, bumper stickers, patches and/or buttons.

	2.	Persons can Vend the following items, which have been created, written or composed by the Vendor or Performer: books, audio, video, or other recordings of their performances, paintings, photographs, prints, sculptures or any other item that is inherently communicative and is of nominal value or utility apart from its communication.

	3.	Although an item may have some expressive purpose, it will be deemed to have more than nominal utility apart from its communication if it has a common and dominant non-expressive purpose. Examples of items that have more than nominal utility apart from their communication and thus are subject to the Vending ban under the provisions of this Section, include but are not limited to, the following: housewares, appliances, articles of clothing, sunglasses, auto parts, oils, incense, perfume, crystals, lotions, candles, jewelry, toys and stuffed animals.

	4.	Performers can Perform.

	5.	Any Vendor conducting lawful Vending under Subsections D.1. and D.2., above, must comply with applicable tax and licensing requirements.

	E.	Allocation and Use of Designated Spaces. The City&#x2019;s Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners shall designate a total of 205 spaces on the Boardwalk, referred to as the &#x201C;Designated Spaces&#x201D;. The Designated Spaces will be available for use in accordance with a first-come, first-served system or any other legally permissible allocation system adopted by the Board at a duly noticed public hearing at which the public is provided an opportunity to comment, as required by the Ralph M. Brown Act, posted at the Recreation Office for at least ten (10) days prior to implementation.

	The 205 Designated Spaces shall be made available for the activities described in Subsection D. above. Five of the Designated Spaces shall be double-sized, large act spaces for Performers whose number of Performers plus audience can be anticipated to exceed 25 Persons. Two of the regular-sized Designated Spaces shall be made available for Persons engaging in any activity that is described in Subsection D. and who are predominantly giving away Food. The remainder of the regular-sized, Designated Spaces shall be made available for Persons engaging in any exempt activity described in Subsection D.

	Persons using the 205 Designated Spaces are subject to, and shall comply with, the following restrictions and the Program Rules adopted by the Board:

	1.	The five double-sized, large act Performer spaces historically have been used by Performers (such as acrobats) whose performances require more space than is available in a single-sized, Designated Space, and have been used by Performers who attract large crowds due to the nature of their performances. The five, double-sized, large act Performer spaces are the only spaces able to safely accommodate large scale performances or a large audience and, therefore, in order to facilitate a variety of Performances in these double-sized spaces, the Performer spaces are subject to a rotation requirement, whereby each Performer using one of the five Performer spaces shall relinquish the space on the hour, every hour, whenever another Performer is waiting to use the Performer space in which the Performer is Performing.

	2.	No Person shall Vend any item in a Designated Space, except as expressly authorized by Subsection D.

	3.	No Person shall place or allow anything in any Designated Space to extend beyond the boundaries of the Designated Space nor place anything adjacent to the Designated Space nor obstruct or impede the access areas between the Designated Spaces.

	4.	No Person shall Vend in, Perform in, or place or allow any item to extend into a designated emergency ingress and egress area. A map depicting the emergency ingress and egress areas is available for inspection and copying at the Police Substation or at the Recreation Office.

	5.	The City desires to balance the goal of avoiding visual clutter and blight against the need of Performers and Vendors exempt pursuant to Subsection D., above, to have shade from the sun. Additionally, the City desires to balance the goal of avoiding visual clutter and blight against the desire of Performers and Vendors exempt pursuant to Subsection D., above to use equipment common to exempted Performing and Vending activities. Accordingly, the following rules relating to shade, Performing and Vending equipment: are adopted as follows: No Person shall place or allow any item (except an umbrella, sun shade, easel, display board or microphone stand) exceeding four feet above ground in any Designated Space, nor shall any Person cause or allow a Designated Space to be enclosed. An umbrella or sun shade shall not exceed 8 feet above ground and shall be open on all sides. An easel, display board or microphone stand shall not exceed 6 feet in height. Persons shall not hang objects of any nature on or from any umbrella, sun shade, easel or display board.

	6.	No Person occupying a Designated Space shall leave that Designated Space for a period longer than 45 consecutive minutes without first removing all items from the Designated Space.

	7.	No Person shall occupy more than one single regular-sized or double-sized Designated Space at any given time, nor shall any Person solicit another Person to obtain or occupy a Designated Space on his or her behalf.

	8.	No Person shall purchase, sell, barter or exchange any Designated Space with any other Person.

	9.	No Person shall set up or set down items in, take down items from or block, or attempt to reserve a Designated Space between Sunset and 9:00 a.m.

	10.	Any umbrella used in connection with the activities authorized in the Designated Spaces must be adequately secured in an upright position with a diameter no greater than 8 feet.

	11.	Designated Spaces must be kept clean and free of litter and debris. No permanent markings shall be made in any Designated Space. Any temporary marking made in any Designated Space must be removed from the Designated Space when the Person using the Designated Space vacates the Designated Space or by Sunset, whichever is earlier.

	12.	No open flames combustible fuel or gasoline-fueled generators are allowed in any Designated Space. Electric cords may not be connected outside the assigned space or to any City or private power source.

finds and declares as follows:	1.	The Boardwalk and Recreation Area constitute a
major tourist attraction in the City, hosting approximately 16 million visitors
annually. The Boardwalk and Recreation Area are limited spaces geographically,
located in a narrow, linear City park that is bounded by the beach to the West
and private property to the East. The total width of the Boardwalk is only ten
feet in certain sections and only as wide as 50 feet in other limited areas. The
space is further constrained by the fact the Boardwalk and Recreation Area serve
as emergency ingress and egress routes.	2.	Historically, visitors, including
tourists, have been drawn to Venice beach because, the Boardwalk and Recreation
Area served as a traditional public forum for performance and visual artists, as
well as other free speech activity. Vendors of Food, Goods and Merchandise
viewed the large crowds of visitors to the Boardwalk and Recreation Area as a
pool of potential customers and Vending proliferated. As the numbers of
commercial Vendors increased, the number of Performers and persons engaging in
free speech activities decreased both because of the limited amount of space and
because of the change in atmosphere from a vibrant center of art and expression
to a commercial &#x201C;flea market&#x201D; atmosphere. Competing interests for space on
the Boardwalk and Recreation Area intensified and physical altercations for
space and disturbances of the peace resulted in law enforcement responses and
arrests.	3.	Unregulated Vending and Performances adversely affect the historic
character of the Boardwalk, hamper rather than encourage a wide variety of
performances, visual artists and other free speech activity, as well as
jeopardize the public safety of visitors to the Boardwalk, resulting in an
economic and cultural loss to the City. Therefore, the Boardwalk requires
reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to retain its unique historic
character as a center of performance, art, and other free speech activity,
preserve its status as a tourist attraction, protect the commercial life of the
Boardwalk, and ensure the safety and enjoyment of residents, visitors,
advocates, artists, performers, and Vendors alike. Due to its unique historical,
geographical, and physical characteristics, the Boardwalk requires its own set
of rules and regulations different from other public parks in the
City.	4.	Unregulated Vending and Performing harms the Boardwalk, and therefore
must be regulated because:	(a)	Tourists are deterred from visiting or shopping
at the Boardwalk as they are constantly approached, solicited, and sometimes
harassed by unregulated Vendors and Performers. Regulation is therefore
necessary to manage the time, place, and manner of Vending on the Boardwalk, in
order to ensure that tourists are not deterred from visiting or shopping at the
Boardwalk;	(b)	The amount of space on the Boardwalk that is available for
performing and visual artists and for political advocacy is limited due to the
size of the Boardwalk and the large crowds of visitors that the Boardwalk
attracts. Due to the limited amount of space, unregulated Vending along the
Boardwalk prevents many Persons from engaging in performance, art, advocacy or
other expressive activities. The lack of regulations for Vending, Performing and
noise has resulted in conflicting claims for the available spaces. Numerous
altercations occurred, in competition for locations and amounts of space, during
time periods in which the City lacked regulations for noise and a system for
allocating available space for Vending and Performing. Frequently, the
altercations became violent requiring law enforcement response to preserve the
public peace. Persons wishing to secure spaces often arrive prior to dawn and
create loud noise in setting up their displays, thereby disturbing the public
peace, including the peace of the residents on and near the Boardwalk, and
requiring a law enforcement response. Unregulated, the Boardwalk became a place
where only the strongest and earliest arrivals could secure space to exercise
their rights of free expression without threat of intimidation. Regulation is
necessary, therefore, to manage the use of the limited space on the Boardwalk to
prevent conflicting claims for the space and to allocate the limited space
available fairly to all who desire to use it for lawful purposes;	(c)	Tables,
Pushcarts, stands, and certain equipment of Vendors and Performers impede the
orderly movement of pedestrian traffic along the narrow Boardwalk and may make
the Boardwalk unsafe for pedestrians by limiting the City&#x2019;s ability to effect
crowd management and control. Certain equipment of Vendors and Performers
contributes to visual clutter and blight, especially when it impacts the ability
of Boardwalk visitors to see the Pacific Ocean. Regulating the use of equipment
by Vendors and Performers therefore is necessary to manage the orderly movement
of pedestrian traffic. Regulation also is necessary to avoid injuries to
pedestrians as well as ensure the existence of emergency and non-emergency
ingress and egress between the beach and the Boardwalk;	(d)	The Vendors,
Performers and their equipment impede the ingress and egress of emergency and
public safety vehicles by creating physical obstacles to emergency response and
administration of aid to those in need of immediate medical attention and to
victims of criminal activity. Regulation is therefore necessary to ensure that
Vendors, Performers and their equipment do not interfere with emergency response
vehicles that provide assistance to individuals with medical needs and victims
of criminal activity;	(e)	Unregulated Vending has resulted in the sale of
stolen, defective or counterfeit merchandise. Regulation therefore is necessary
to protect the public and the Boardwalk commercial life;	(f)	Unregulated Vending
of personal services has resulted in activities that are illegal and harmful to
human health, including the offering of services by unlicensed Vendors of
services for which a license is required by the State of California, physical
assaults and the application of toxic chemicals to Persons;	(g)	Unregulated
Vending causes visual clutter/blight along the Boardwalk, impedes views of the
beach and the Pacific Ocean, and threatens the City&#x2019;s ability to attract
tourists and preserve businesses along the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is
necessary to manage the number of Vendors, the size of their equipment and
displays, and the location of Vending activity;	(h)	Unregulated Vending creates
unnecessary, excessive and annoying noise on the Boardwalk, is detrimental to
the public health, welfare and safety and contrary to the public interest, harms
residents, the commercial life of the Boardwalk and the historic character of
the Boardwalk, and diminishes the quality of life for those who visit, live or
work on or near the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is necessary to establish
restrictions on noise at the Boardwalk; and	(i)	The Recreation Area is a site
that is uniquely suitable to and frequently used for events that require
pre-planning and advanced notice. The Recreation Area is the location of the
Police Substation where vehicles require the ability for unobstructed ingress
and egress. Due to the size, shape, and physical attributes of the Recreation
Area (including a skate park and plaza, paddle tennis courts and exercise
equipment), it is also a site uniquely suitable to and used by many Persons for
skateboarding, paddle tennis, and other sports and exercise. The Recreation Area
is the home of historic &#x201C;Muscle Beach&#x201D;, a popular tourist attraction. Muscle
Beach is world renowned as home of physical fitness advocates and body builders,
including Jack La Lanne (considered to be the father of the modern fitness
movement), Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbo and Dave Draper.	C.	Beach
Vending Prohibition. Except as specifically allowed in this Section, no Person
shall engage in Vending upon any public beach lands or properties adjoining the
waterfront of the Pacific Ocean, or upon any immediately adjacent Boardwalk,
sidewalk or public way between the southerly boundary of the City of Santa
Monica and the northerly boundary of the City of El Segundo and between the
northwesterly boundary of the City of Santa Monica and the northwesterly
boundary of the City of Los Angeles.	D.	Vending and Performing on Designated
Spaces. To address the findings and purposes set forth in this Section, the City
has created reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on Vending and
noise, as well as to facilitate Performing. To preserve the Boardwalk&#x2019;s rich
history of fostering new artists, performance, and other free speech activity,
the City has divided the available space on the Boardwalk into 205 areas, known
as Designated Spaces, where:	1.	Persons can engage in traditional expressive
speech and petitioning activities, and can Vend the following expressive items:
newspapers, leaflets, pamphlets, bumper stickers, patches and/or
buttons.	2.	Persons can Vend the following items, which have been created,
written or composed by the Vendor or Performer: books, audio, video, or other
recordings of their performances, paintings, photographs, prints, sculptures or
any other item that is inherently communicative and is of nominal value or
utility apart from its communication.	3.	Although an item may have some
expressive purpose, it will be deemed to have more than nominal utility apart
from its communication if it has a common and dominant non-expressive purpose.
Examples of items that have more than nominal utility apart from their
communication and thus are subject to the Vending ban under the provisions of
this Section, include but are not limited to, the following: housewares,
appliances, articles of clothing, sunglasses, auto parts, oils, incense,
perfume, crystals, lotions, candles, jewelry, toys and stuffed
animals.	4.	Performers can Perform.	5.	Any Vendor conducting lawful Vending
under Subsections D.1. and D.2., above, must comply with applicable tax and
licensing requirements.	E.	Allocation and Use of Designated Spaces. The City&#x2019;s
Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners shall designate a total of 205
spaces on the Boardwalk, referred to as the &#x201C;Designated Spaces&#x201D;. The
Designated Spaces will be available for use in accordance with a first-come,
first-served system or any other legally permissible allocation system adopted
by the Board at a duly noticed public hearing at which the public is provided an
opportunity to comment, as required by the Ralph M. Brown Act, posted at the
Recreation Office for at least ten (10) days prior to implementation.	The 205
Designated Spaces shall be made available for the activities described in
Subsection D. above. Five of the Designated Spaces shall be double-sized, large
act spaces for Performers whose number of Performers plus audience can be
anticipated to exceed 25 Persons. Two of the regular-sized Designated Spaces
shall be made available for Persons engaging in any activity that is described
in Subsection D. and who are predominantly giving away Food. The remainder of
the regular-sized, Designated Spaces shall be made available for Persons
engaging in any exempt activity described in Subsection D.	Persons using the 205
Designated Spaces are subject to, and shall comply with, the following
restrictions and the Program Rules adopted by the Board:	1.	The five
double-sized, large act Performer spaces historically have been used by
Performers (such as acrobats) whose performances require more space than is
available in a single-sized, Designated Space, and have been used by Performers
who attract large crowds due to the nature of their performances. The five,
double-sized, large act Performer spaces are the only spaces able to safely
accommodate large scale performances or a large audience and, therefore, in
order to facilitate a variety of Performances in these double-sized spaces, the
Performer spaces are subject to a rotation requirement, whereby each Performer
using one of the five Performer spaces shall relinquish the space on the hour,
every hour, whenever another Performer is waiting to use the Performer space in
which the Performer is Performing.	2.	No Person shall Vend any item in a
Designated Space, except as expressly authorized by Subsection D.	3.	No Person
shall place or allow anything in any Designated Space to extend beyond the
boundaries of the Designated Space nor place anything adjacent to the Designated
Space nor obstruct or impede the access areas between the Designated
Spaces.	4.	No Person shall Vend in, Perform in, or place or allow any item to
extend into a designated emergency ingress and egress area. A map depicting the
emergency ingress and egress areas is available for inspection and copying at
the Police Substation or at the Recreation Office.	5.	The City desires to
balance the goal of avoiding visual clutter and blight against the need of
Performers and Vendors exempt pursuant to Subsection D., above, to have shade
from the sun. Additionally, the City desires to balance the goal of avoiding
visual clutter and blight against the desire of Performers and Vendors exempt
pursuant to Subsection D., above to use equipment common to exempted Performing
and Vending activities. Accordingly, the following rules relating to shade,
Performing and Vending equipment: are adopted as follows: No Person shall place
or allow any item (except an umbrella, sun shade, easel, display board or
microphone stand) exceeding four feet above ground in any Designated Space, nor
shall any Person cause or allow a Designated Space to be enclosed. An umbrella
or sun shade shall not exceed 8 feet above ground and shall be open on all
sides. An easel, display board or microphone stand shall not exceed 6 feet in
height. Persons shall not hang objects of any nature on or from any umbrella,
sun shade, easel or display board.	6.	No Person occupying a Designated Space
shall leave that Designated Space for a period longer than 45 consecutive
minutes without first removing all items from the Designated Space.	7.	No Person
shall occupy more than one single regular-sized or double-sized Designated Space
at any given time, nor shall any Person solicit another Person to obtain or
occupy a Designated Space on his or her behalf.	8.	No Person shall purchase,
sell, barter or exchange any Designated Space with any other Person.	9.	No
Person shall set up or set down items in, take down items from or block, or
attempt to reserve a Designated Space between Sunset and 9:00 a.m.	10.	Any
umbrella used in connection with the activities authorized in the Designated
Spaces must be adequately secured in an upright position with a diameter no
greater than 8 feet.	11.	Designated Spaces must be kept clean and free of litter
and debris. No permanent markings shall be made in any Designated Space. Any
temporary marking made in any Designated Space must be removed from the
Designated Space when the Person using the Designated Space vacates the
Designated Space or by Sunset, whichever is earlier.	12.	No open flames
combustible fuel or gasoline-fueled generators are allowed in any Designated
Space. Electric cords may not be connected outside the assigned space or to any
City or private power source.	F.	Special Rules for Other Areas of the
Boardwalk.	1.	Areas Outside of the Designated Spaces, Pagodas, and Recreation
Area.	(a)	Areas where use of equipment is prohibited. The activities described
in Subsection D. may occur in all areas covered by this Section outside the
Designated Spaces, Pagodas, and Recreation Area, provided that no Person may set
up a display table, easel, stand, equipment or other furniture, use a Pushcart
or other vehicle or place any item on the property defined in Subsection C.
except as provided in Paragraph (b) of this Subdivision.	(b)	Areas where limited
use of equipment is permitted. The activities described in Subsection D., but
not including Vending, may occur on the Westside of the Boardwalk outside the
Designated Spaces, Pagodas, Recreation Area and other areas designed as access
points for or constitute routes for emergency ingress and egress. In connection
with permissible activities in the area on the Westside of the Boardwalk,
outside the Designated Spaces, Pagodas, Recreation Area and other areas
designated for emergency ingress and egress, a Person may set up a display
table, easel, stand, equipment or other furniture, a Pushcart or other vehicle,
or place an item on the ground in the areas where limited use of equipment is
permitted, subject to reasonable size and height restrictions set forth in
paragraph E.5., herein, provided the equipment or the activity associated with
the equipment does not materially impede or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular
traffic or areas designed for emergency ingress and egress. Nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed to allow a person to use or set up equipment in
connection with Vending.	(c)	The areas in which use of equipment is prohibited
and areas in which limited use of equipment is permitted is available for
inspection and copying at Police Substation or Recreation Office.	2.	The
Recreation Area.	(a)	The Recreation Area is a limited space containing a
confluence of public safety ingress and egress routes, and at which pre-planned
events, recreation activities and tourism occur. The City&#x2019;s Board of
Recreation and Parks Commissioners may allocate use of the Recreation Area
through the adoption of Program Rules detailing an advance reservation system or
any other legally permissible allocation system, and the advance reservation
system or other legally permissible allocation system contained in the Program
Rules will be adopted by the Board at a duly noticed public hearing at which the
public is provided an opportunity to comment, as required by the Ralph M. Brown
Act, and made effective after reasonable public notice by posting at the
Recreation Office for at least ten (10) days prior to implementation. A copy of
the Program Rules shall be available for inspection and copying at the Police
Substation or the Recreation Office.	(b)	No Vending, and no display tables,
easels, stands, equipment, Pushcarts or other vehicles, or structures shall be
allowed in the Recreation Area except as may be expressly authorized by the
Board in connection with the Board&#x2019;s pre-approval of the use of the Recreation
Area.	(c)	No Person shall use the Recreation Area or any part of the Recreation
Area while the Recreation Area or that part of the Recreation Area has been
reserved, set aside, is being used, set up, maintained or designed for a
specific recreational purpose, park purpose or event authorized by the City
through the Department or Board. When the City, through the Department or Board,

The City Council of the City of Los Angeles finds and declares as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.	The Boardwalk and Recreation Area constitute a major tourist attraction in the City, hosting approximately 16 million visitors annually. The Boardwalk and Recreation Area are limited spaces geographically, located in a narrow, linear City park that is bounded by the beach to the West and private property to the East. The total width of the Boardwalk is only ten feet in certain sections and only as wide as 50 feet in other limited areas. The space is further constrained by the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt; the Boardwalk and Recreation Area serve as emergency ingress and egress routes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	Historically, visitors, including tourists, have been drawn to Venice beach because, the Boardwalk and Recreation Area served as a traditional public forum for performance and visual artists, as well as other free speech activity. Vendors of Food, Goods and Merchandise viewed the large crowds of visitors to the Boardwalk and Recreation Area as a pool of potential customers and Vending proliferated. As the numbers of commercial Vendors increased, the number of Performers and persons engaging in free speech activities decreased both because of the limited amount of space and because of the change in atmosphere from a vibrant center of art and expression to a commercial &#x201C;flea market&#x201D; atmosphere. Competing interests for space on the Boardwalk and Recreation Area intensified and physical altercations for space and disturbances of the peace resulted in &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;law&lt;/span&gt; enforcement responses and &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;arrests&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	Unregulated Vending and Performances adversely affect the historic character of the Boardwalk, hamper rather than encourage a wide variety of performances, visual artists and other free speech activity, as well as jeopardize the public safety of visitors to the Boardwalk, resulting in an economic and cultural loss to the City. Therefore, the Boardwalk requires reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to retain its unique historic character as a center of performance, art, and other free speech activity, preserve its status as a tourist attraction, protect the commercial life of the Boardwalk, and ensure the safety and enjoyment of residents, visitors, advocates, artists, performers, and Vendors alike. Due to its unique historical, geographical, and physical characteristics, the Boardwalk requires its own set of rules and regulations different from other public parks in the City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	4.	Unregulated Vending and Performing harms the Boardwalk, and therefore must be regulated because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(a)	Tourists are deterred from visiting or shopping at the Boardwalk as they are constantly approached, solicited, and sometimes harassed by unregulated Vendors and Performers. Regulation is therefore necessary to manage the time, place, and manner of Vending on the Boardwalk, in &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; to ensure that tourists are not deterred from visiting or shopping at the Boardwalk;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(b)	The amount of space on the Boardwalk that is available for performing and visual artists and for political advocacy is limited due to the size of the Boardwalk and the large crowds of visitors that the Boardwalk attracts. Due to the limited amount of space, unregulated Vending along the Boardwalk prevents many Persons from engaging in performance, art, advocacy or other expressive activities. The lack of regulations for Vending, Performing and noise has resulted in conflicting claims for the available spaces. Numerous altercations occurred, in competition for locations and amounts of space, during time periods in which the City lacked regulations for noise and a system for allocating available space for Vending and Performing. Frequently, the altercations became violent requiring &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;law&lt;/span&gt; enforcement response to preserve the public peace. Persons wishing to secure spaces often arrive prior to dawn and create loud noise in setting up their displays, thereby disturbing the public peace, including the peace of the residents on and near the Boardwalk, and requiring a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;law&lt;/span&gt; enforcement response. Unregulated, the Boardwalk became a place where only the strongest and earliest arrivals could secure space to exercise their rights of free expression without threat of intimidation. Regulation is necessary, therefore, to manage the use of the limited space on the Boardwalk to prevent conflicting claims for the space and to allocate the limited space available fairly to all who desire to use it for lawful purposes;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(c)	Tables, Pushcarts, stands, and certain equipment of Vendors and Performers impede the orderly movement of pedestrian traffic along the narrow Boardwalk and may make the Boardwalk unsafe for pedestrians by limiting the City&#x2019;s ability to effect crowd management and control. Certain equipment of Vendors and Performers contributes to visual clutter and blight, especially when it impacts the ability of Boardwalk visitors to see the Pacific Ocean. Regulating the use of equipment by Vendors and Performers therefore is necessary to manage the orderly movement of pedestrian traffic. Regulation also is necessary to avoid injuries to pedestrians as well as ensure the existence of emergency and non-emergency ingress and egress between the beach and the Boardwalk;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(d)	The Vendors, Performers and their equipment impede the ingress and egress of emergency and public safety vehicles by creating physical obstacles to emergency response and administration of aid to those in need of immediate medical attention and to victims of criminal activity. Regulation is therefore necessary to ensure that Vendors, Performers and their equipment do not interfere with emergency response vehicles that provide assistance to individuals with medical needs and victims of criminal activity;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(e)	Unregulated Vending has resulted in the sale of stolen, defective or counterfeit merchandise. Regulation therefore is necessary to protect the public and the Boardwalk commercial life;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(f)	Unregulated Vending of personal services has resulted in activities that are illegal and harmful to human health, including the offering of services by unlicensed Vendors of services for which a license is required by the State of California, physical &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;assaults&lt;/span&gt; and the application of toxic chemicals to Persons;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(g)	Unregulated Vending causes visual clutter/blight along the Boardwalk, impedes views of the beach and the Pacific Ocean, and threatens the City&#x2019;s ability to attract tourists and preserve businesses along the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is necessary to manage the number of Vendors, the size of their equipment and displays, and the location of Vending activity;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(h)	Unregulated Vending creates unnecessary, excessive and annoying noise on the Boardwalk, is detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety and contrary to the public interest, harms residents, the commercial life of the Boardwalk and the historic character of the Boardwalk, and diminishes the quality of life for those who visit, live or work on or near the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is necessary to establish restrictions on noise at the Boardwalk; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	The Recreation Area is a site that is uniquely suitable to and frequently used for events that require pre-planning and advanced notice. The Recreation Area is the location of the Police Substation where vehicles require the ability for unobstructed ingress and egress. Due to the size, shape, and physical attributes of the Recreation Area (including a skate park and plaza, paddle tennis &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;courts&lt;/span&gt; and exercise equipment), it is also a site uniquely suitable to and used by many Persons for skateboarding, paddle tennis, and other sports and exercise. The Recreation Area is the home of historic &#x201C;Muscle Beach&#x201D;, a popular tourist attraction. Muscle Beach is world renowned as home of physical fitness advocates and body builders, including Jack La Lanne (considered to be the father of the modern fitness movement), Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbo and Dave Draper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	C.	Beach Vending Prohibition. Except as specifically allowed in this Section, no Person shall engage in Vending upon any public beach lands or properties adjoining the waterfront of the Pacific Ocean, or upon any immediately adjacent Boardwalk, sidewalk or public way between the southerly boundary of the City of Santa Monica and the northerly boundary of the City of El Segundo and between the northwesterly boundary of the City of Santa Monica and the northwesterly boundary of the City of Los Angeles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	D.	Vending and Performing on Designated Spaces. To address the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; and purposes set forth in this Section, the City has created reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on Vending and noise, as well as to facilitate Performing. To preserve the Boardwalk&#x2019;s rich history of fostering new artists, performance, and other free speech activity, the City has divided the available space on the Boardwalk into 205 areas, known as Designated Spaces, where:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.	Persons can engage in traditional expressive speech and petitioning activities, and can Vend the following expressive items: newspapers, leaflets, pamphlets, bumper stickers, patches and/or buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	Persons can Vend the following items, which have been created, written or composed by the Vendor or Performer: books, audio, video, or other recordings of their performances, paintings, photographs, prints, sculptures or any other item that is inherently communicative and is of nominal value or utility apart from its communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	Although an item may have some expressive purpose, it will be deemed to have more than nominal utility apart from its communication if it has a common and dominant non-expressive purpose. Examples of items that have more than nominal utility apart from their communication and thus are subject to the Vending ban under the provisions of this Section, include but are not limited to, the following: housewares, appliances, articles of clothing, sunglasses, auto parts, oils, incense, perfume, crystals, lotions, candles, jewelry, toys and stuffed animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	4.	Performers can Perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	5.	Any Vendor conducting lawful Vending under Subsections D.1. and D.2., above, must comply with applicable tax and licensing requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	E.	Allocation and Use of Designated Spaces. The City&#x2019;s Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners shall designate a total of 205 spaces on the Boardwalk, referred to as the &#x201C;Designated Spaces&#x201D;. The Designated Spaces will be available for use in accordance with a first-come, first-served system or any other legally permissible allocation system adopted by the Board at a duly noticed public &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; at which the public is provided an opportunity to comment, as required by the Ralph M. Brown Act, posted at the Recreation Office for at least ten (10) days prior to implementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	The 205 Designated Spaces shall be made available for the activities described in Subsection D. above. Five of the Designated Spaces shall be double-sized, large act spaces for Performers whose number of Performers plus audience can be anticipated to exceed 25 Persons. Two of the regular-sized Designated Spaces shall be made available for Persons engaging in any activity that is described in Subsection D. and who are predominantly giving away Food. The remainder of the regular-sized, Designated Spaces shall be made available for Persons engaging in any exempt activity described in Subsection D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Persons using the 205 Designated Spaces are subject to, and shall comply with, the following restrictions and the Program Rules adopted by the Board:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.	The five double-sized, large act Performer spaces historically have been used by Performers (such as acrobats) whose performances require more space than is available in a single-sized, Designated Space, and have been used by Performers who attract large crowds due to the nature of their performances. The five, double-sized, large act Performer spaces are the only spaces able to safely accommodate large scale performances or a large audience and, therefore, in &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; to facilitate a variety of Performances in these double-sized spaces, the Performer spaces are subject to a rotation requirement, whereby each Performer using one of the five Performer spaces shall relinquish the space on the hour, every hour, whenever another Performer is waiting to use the Performer space in which the Performer is Performing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	No Person shall Vend any item in a Designated Space, except as expressly authorized by Subsection D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	No Person shall place or allow anything in any Designated Space to extend beyond the boundaries of the Designated Space nor place anything adjacent to the Designated Space nor obstruct or impede the access areas between the Designated Spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	4.	No Person shall Vend in, Perform in, or place or allow any item to extend into a designated emergency ingress and egress area. A map depicting the emergency ingress and egress areas is available for inspection and copying at the Police Substation or at the Recreation Office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	5.	The City desires to balance the goal of avoiding visual clutter and blight against the need of Performers and Vendors exempt pursuant to Subsection D., above, to have shade from the sun. Additionally, the City desires to balance the goal of avoiding visual clutter and blight against the desire of Performers and Vendors exempt pursuant to Subsection D., above to use equipment common to exempted Performing and Vending activities. Accordingly, the following rules relating to shade, Performing and Vending equipment: are adopted as follows: No Person shall place or allow any item (except an umbrella, sun shade, easel, display board or microphone stand) exceeding four feet above ground in any Designated Space, nor shall any Person cause or allow a Designated Space to be enclosed. An umbrella or sun shade shall not exceed 8 feet above ground and shall be open on all sides. An easel, display board or microphone stand shall not exceed 6 feet in height. Persons shall not hang &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt; of any nature on or from any umbrella, sun shade, easel or display board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	6.	No Person occupying a Designated Space shall leave that Designated Space for a period longer than 45 consecutive minutes without first removing all items from the Designated Space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	7.	No Person shall occupy more than one single regular-sized or double-sized Designated Space at any given time, nor shall any Person solicit another Person to obtain or occupy a Designated Space on his or her behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	8.	No Person shall purchase, sell, barter or exchange any Designated Space with any other Person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	9.	No Person shall set up or set down items in, take down items from or block, or attempt to reserve a Designated Space between Sunset and 9:00 a.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	10.	Any umbrella used in connection with the activities authorized in the Designated Spaces must be adequately secured in an upright position with a diameter no greater than 8 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	11.	Designated Spaces must be kept clean and free of litter and debris. No permanent markings shall be made in any Designated Space. Any temporary marking made in any Designated Space must be removed from the Designated Space when the Person using the Designated Space vacates the Designated Space or by Sunset, whichever is earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	12.	No open flames combustible fuel or gasoline-fueled generators are allowed in any Designated Space. Electric cords may not be connected outside the assigned space or to any City or private power source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	F.

The activities described in Subsection D., but not including Vending, may occur on the Westside of the Boardwalk outside the Designated Spaces, Pagodas, Recreation Area and other areas designed as access points for or constitute routes for emergency ingress and egress. In connection with permissible activities in the area on the Westside of the Boardwalk, outside the Designated Spaces, Pagodas, Recreation Area and other areas designated for emergency ingress and egress, a Person may set up a display table, easel, stand, equipment or other furniture, a Pushcart or other vehicle, or place an item on the ground in the areas where limited use of equipment is permitted, subject to reasonable size and height restrictions set forth in paragraph E.5., herein, provided the equipment or the activity associated with the equipment does not materially impede or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic or areas designed for emergency ingress and egress. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow a person to use or set up equipment in connection with Vending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(c)	The areas in which use of equipment is prohibited and areas in which limited use of equipment is permitted is available for inspection and copying at Police Substation or Recreation Office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	The Recreation Area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(a)	The Recreation Area is a limited space containing a confluence of public safety ingress and egress routes, and at which pre-planned events, recreation activities and tourism occur.

The City Council of the City of Los Angeles finds and declares as follows:	1.	The Boardwalk and Recreation Area constitute a major tourist attraction in the City, hosting approximately 16 million visitors annually. The Boardwalk and Recreation Area are limited spaces geographically, located in a narrow, linear City park that is bounded by the beach to the West and private property to the East. The total width of the Boardwalk is only ten feet in certain sections and only as wide as 50 feet in other limited areas. The space is further constrained by the fact the Boardwalk and Recreation Area serve as emergency ingress and egress routes.	2.	Historically, visitors, including tourists, have been drawn to Venice beach because, the Boardwalk and Recreation Area served as a traditional public forum for performance and visual artists, as well as other free speech activity. Vendors of Food, Goods and Merchandise viewed the large crowds of visitors to the Boardwalk and Recreation Area as a pool of potential customers and Vending proliferated. As the numbers of commercial Vendors increased, the number of Performers and persons engaging in free speech activities decreased both because of the limited amount of space and because of the change in atmosphere from a vibrant center of art and expression to a commercial &#x201C;flea market&#x201D; atmosphere. Competing interests for space on the Boardwalk and Recreation Area intensified and physical altercations for space and disturbances of the peace resulted in law enforcement responses and arrests.	3.	Unregulated Vending and Performances adversely affect the historic character of the Boardwalk, hamper rather than encourage a wide variety of performances, visual artists and other free speech activity, as well as jeopardize the public safety of visitors to the Boardwalk, resulting in an economic and cultural loss to the City. Therefore, the Boardwalk requires reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to retain its unique historic character as a center of performance, art, and other free speech activity, preserve its status as a tourist attraction, protect the commercial life of the Boardwalk, and ensure the safety and enjoyment of residents, visitors, advocates, artists, performers, and Vendors alike. Due to its unique historical, geographical, and physical characteristics, the Boardwalk requires its own set of rules and regulations different from other public parks in the City.	4.	Unregulated Vending and Performing harms the Boardwalk, and therefore must be regulated because:	(a)	Tourists are deterred from visiting or shopping at the Boardwalk as they are constantly approached, solicited, and sometimes harassed by unregulated Vendors and Performers. Regulation is therefore necessary to manage the time, place, and manner of Vending on the Boardwalk, in order to ensure that tourists are not deterred from visiting or shopping at the Boardwalk;	(b)	The amount of space on the Boardwalk that is available for performing and visual artists and for political advocacy is limited due to the size of the Boardwalk and the large crowds of visitors that the Boardwalk attracts. Due to the limited amount of space, unregulated Vending along the Boardwalk prevents many Persons from engaging in performance, art, advocacy or other expressive activities. The lack of regulations for Vending, Performing and noise has resulted in conflicting claims for the available spaces. Numerous altercations occurred, in competition for locations and amounts of space, during time periods in which the City lacked regulations for noise and a system for allocating available space for Vending and Performing. Frequently, the altercations became violent requiring law enforcement response to preserve the public peace. Persons wishing to secure spaces often arrive prior to dawn and create loud noise in setting up their displays, thereby disturbing the public peace, including the peace of the residents on and near the Boardwalk, and requiring a law enforcement response. Unregulated, the Boardwalk became a place where only the strongest and earliest arrivals could secure space to exercise their rights of free expression without threat of intimidation. Regulation is necessary, therefore, to manage the use of the limited space on the Boardwalk to prevent conflicting claims for the space and to allocate the limited space available fairly to all who desire to use it for lawful purposes;	(c)	Tables, Pushcarts, stands, and certain equipment of Vendors and Performers impede the orderly movement of pedestrian traffic along the narrow Boardwalk and may make the Boardwalk unsafe for pedestrians by limiting the City&#x2019;s ability to effect crowd management and control. Certain equipment of Vendors and Performers contributes to visual clutter and blight, especially when it impacts the ability of Boardwalk visitors to see the Pacific Ocean. Regulating the use of equipment by Vendors and Performers therefore is necessary to manage the orderly movement of pedestrian traffic. Regulation also is necessary to avoid injuries to pedestrians as well as ensure the existence of emergency and non-emergency ingress and egress between the beach and the Boardwalk;	(d)	The Vendors, Performers and their equipment impede the ingress and egress of emergency and public safety vehicles by creating physical obstacles to emergency response and administration of aid to those in need of immediate medical attention and to victims of criminal activity. Regulation is therefore necessary to ensure that Vendors, Performers and their equipment do not interfere with emergency response vehicles that provide assistance to individuals with medical needs and victims of criminal activity;	(e)	Unregulated Vending has resulted in the sale of stolen, defective or counterfeit merchandise. Regulation therefore is necessary to protect the public and the Boardwalk commercial life;	(f)	Unregulated Vending of personal services has resulted in activities that are illegal and harmful to human health, including the offering of services by unlicensed Vendors of services for which a license is required by the State of California, physical assaults and the application of toxic chemicals to Persons;	(g)	Unregulated Vending causes visual clutter/blight along the Boardwalk, impedes views of the beach and the Pacific Ocean, and threatens the City&#x2019;s ability to attract tourists and preserve businesses along the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is necessary to manage the number of Vendors, the size of their equipment and displays, and the location of Vending activity;	(h)	Unregulated Vending creates unnecessary, excessive and annoying noise on the Boardwalk, is detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety and contrary to the public interest, harms residents, the commercial life of the Boardwalk and the historic character of the Boardwalk, and diminishes the quality of life for those who visit, live or work on or near the Boardwalk. Regulation therefore is necessary to establish restrictions on noise at the Boardwalk; and	(i)	The Recreation Area is a site that is uniquely suitable to and frequently used for events that require pre-planning and advanced notice. The Recreation Area is the location of the Police Substation where vehicles require the ability for unobstructed ingress and egress. Due to the size, shape, and physical attributes of the Recreation Area (including a skate park and plaza, paddle tennis courts and exercise equipment), it is also a site uniquely suitable to and used by many Persons for skateboarding, paddle tennis, and other sports and exercise. The Recreation Area is the home of historic &#x201C;Muscle Beach&#x201D;, a popular tourist attraction. Muscle Beach is world renowned as home of physical fitness advocates and body builders, including Jack La Lanne (considered to be the father of the modern fitness movement), Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbo and Dave Draper.	C.	Beach Vending Prohibition. Except as specifically allowed in this Section, no Person shall engage in Vending upon any public beach lands or properties adjoining the waterfront of the Pacific Ocean, or upon any immediately adjacent Boardwalk, sidewalk or public way between the southerly boundary of the City of Santa Monica and the northerly boundary of the City of El Segundo and between the northwesterly boundary of the City of Santa Monica and the northwesterly boundary of the City of Los Angeles.	D.	Vending and Performing on Designated Spaces. To address the findings and purposes set forth in this Section, the City has created reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on Vending and noise, as well as to facilitate Performing. To preserve the Boardwalk&#x2019;s rich history of fostering new artists, performance, and other free speech activity, the City has divided the available space on the Boardwalk into 205 areas, known as Designated Spaces, where:	1.	Persons can engage in traditional expressive speech and petitioning activities, and can Vend the following expressive items: newspapers, leaflets, pamphlets, bumper stickers, patches and/or buttons.	2.	Persons can Vend the following items, which have been created, written or composed by the Vendor or Performer: books, audio, video, or other recordings of their performances, paintings, photographs, prints, sculptures or any other item that is inherently communicative and is of nominal value or utility apart from its communication.	3.	Although an item may have some expressive purpose, it will be deemed to have more than nominal utility apart from its communication if it has a common and dominant non-expressive purpose. Examples of items that have more than nominal utility apart from their communication and thus are subject to the Vending ban under the provisions of this Section, include but are not limited to, the following: housewares, appliances, articles of clothing, sunglasses, auto parts, oils, incense, perfume, crystals, lotions, candles, jewelry, toys and stuffed animals.	4.	Performers can Perform.	5.	Any Vendor conducting lawful Vending under Subsections D.1. and D.2., above, must comply with applicable tax and licensing requirements.	E.	Allocation and Use of Designated Spaces. The City&#x2019;s Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners shall designate a total of 205 spaces on the Boardwalk, referred to as the &#x201C;Designated Spaces&#x201D;. The Designated Spaces will be available for use in accordance with a first-come, first-served system or any other legally permissible allocation system adopted by the Board at a duly noticed public hearing at which the public is provided an opportunity to comment, as required by the Ralph M. Brown Act, posted at the Recreation Office for at least ten (10) days prior to implementation.	The 205 Designated Spaces shall be made available for the activities described in Subsection D. above. Five of the Designated Spaces shall be double-sized, large act spaces for Performers whose number of Performers plus audience can be anticipated to exceed 25 Persons. Two of the regular-sized Designated Spaces shall be made available for Persons engaging in any activity that is described in Subsection D. and who are predominantly giving away Food. The remainder of the regular-sized, Designated Spaces shall be made available for Persons engaging in any exempt activity described in Subsection D.	Persons using the 205 Designated Spaces are subject to, and shall comply with, the following restrictions and the Program Rules adopted by the Board:	1.	The five double-sized, large act Performer spaces historically have been used by Performers (such as acrobats) whose performances require more space than is available in a single-sized, Designated Space, and have been used by Performers who attract large crowds due to the nature of their performances. The five, double-sized, large act Performer spaces are the only spaces able to safely accommodate large scale performances or a large audience and, therefore, in order to facilitate a variety of Performances in these double-sized spaces, the Performer spaces are subject to a rotation requirement, whereby each Performer using one of the five Performer spaces shall relinquish the space on the hour, every hour, whenever another Performer is waiting to use the Performer space in which the Performer is Performing.	2.	No Person shall Vend any item in a Designated Space, except as expressly authorized by Subsection D.	3.	No Person shall place or allow anything in any Designated Space to extend beyond the boundaries of the Designated Space nor place anything adjacent to the Designated Space nor obstruct or impede the access areas between the Designated Spaces.	4.	No Person shall Vend in, Perform in, or place or allow any item to extend into a designated emergency ingress and egress area. A map depicting the emergency ingress and egress areas is available for inspection and copying at the Police Substation or at the Recreation Office.	5.	The City desires to balance the goal of avoiding visual clutter and blight against the need of Performers and Vendors exempt pursuant to Subsection D., above, to have shade from the sun. Additionally, the City desires to balance the goal of avoiding visual clutter and blight against the desire of Performers and Vendors exempt pursuant to Subsection D., above to use equipment common to exempted Performing and Vending activities. Accordingly, the following rules relating to shade, Performing and Vending equipment: are adopted as follows: No Person shall place or allow any item (except an umbrella, sun shade, easel, display board or microphone stand) exceeding four feet above ground in any Designated Space, nor shall any Person cause or allow a Designated Space to be enclosed. An umbrella or sun shade shall not exceed 8 feet above ground and shall be open on all sides. An easel, display board or microphone stand shall not exceed 6 feet in height. Persons shall not hang objects of any nature on or from any umbrella, sun shade, easel or display board.	6.	No Person occupying a Designated Space shall leave that Designated Space for a period longer than 45 consecutive minutes without first removing all items from the Designated Space.	7.	No Person shall occupy more than one single regular-sized or double-sized Designated Space at any given time, nor shall any Person solicit another Person to obtain or occupy a Designated Space on his or her behalf.	8.	No Person shall purchase, sell, barter or exchange any Designated Space with any other Person.	9.	No Person shall set up or set down items in, take down items from or block, or attempt to reserve a Designated Space between Sunset and 9:00 a.m.	10.	Any umbrella used in connection with the activities authorized in the Designated Spaces must be adequately secured in an upright position with a diameter no greater than 8 feet.	11.	Designated Spaces must be kept clean and free of litter and debris. No permanent markings shall be made in any Designated Space. Any temporary marking made in any Designated Space must be removed from the Designated Space when the Person using the Designated Space vacates the Designated Space or by Sunset, whichever is earlier.	12.	No open flames combustible fuel or gasoline-fueled generators are allowed in any Designated Space. Electric cords may not be connected outside the assigned space or to any City or private power source.	F.	Special Rules for Other Areas of the Boardwalk.	1.

(b)	Areas where limited use of equipment is permitted. The activities described in Subsection D., but not including Vending, may occur on the Westside of the Boardwalk outside the Designated Spaces, Pagodas, Recreation Area and other areas designed as access points for or constitute routes for emergency ingress and egress. In connection with permissible activities in the area on the Westside of the Boardwalk, outside the Designated Spaces, Pagodas, Recreation Area and other areas designated for emergency ingress and egress, a Person may set up a display table, easel, stand, equipment or other furniture, a Pushcart or other vehicle, or place an item on the ground in the areas where limited use of equipment is permitted, subject to reasonable size and height restrictions set forth in paragraph E.5., herein, provided the equipment or the activity associated with the equipment does not materially impede or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic or areas designed for emergency ingress and egress.
