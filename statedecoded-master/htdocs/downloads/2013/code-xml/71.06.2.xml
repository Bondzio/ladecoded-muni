	(Re-added by Ord. No. 171,247, Eff. 9/27/96.)

	Upon request to the Department of Transportation with respect to matters involving the regulation of vehicles defined in Section 71.00, the Department may assign staff to provide services outside of normal working hours, subject to payment to the City of its costs as hereinafter provided:

	(a)	Each such request must be received by the Department no less than one week prior to the time for which services are requested.

	(b)	In each such instance the Department of Transportation shall charge and collect the total costs of Departmental work, services, and materials provided outside of normal working hours.

	(c)	Prior to the Department proceeding pursuant to any such request, the applicant requesting services outside of normal working hours shall deposit with the City that sum estimated by the Department to be sufficient to pay the City for all City costs with respect thereto.

	(d)	The deposit may vary in amount from time to time depending upon the scope of the costs and expenses reasonably anticipated as necessary to provide the work, services, and materials to be used for the services requested, provided that the estimated sum required to be deposited shall be based upon and not be inconsistent with the actual costs of similar work done by, and materials used by, the Department in the regular course of its duties.

	(e)	The Department shall estimate the amount of the deposit in conformity with a schedule adopted by the General Manager on a semiannual or less frequent basis which sets forth and applies then current salary schedules and verifiable time and materials costs of the City with respect to those types of Departmental activities.&#xA0; The schedule shall be kept on file by the Department and be available to any applicant depositor at the time an application is made or as otherwise requested.

	(f)	Money received as a deposit from an applicant shall be deposited into the Department of Transportation Trust Fund and shall be transferred to the General Fund to first reimburse the Departmental costs incurred in providing services and materials referred to in Subsection (b) above for the applicant-depositor.

	(g)	As a condition to the Department proceedings set forth above, any deposit accepted pursuant to this section shall be adjusted at the completion of the services requested to conform to actual costs as follows:

	1.	In the event actual costs incurred by the City are less than the deposit received by the City, the applicant shall be entitled to reimbursement of the excess from the deposit; and

	2.	In the event the costs exceed the sum on deposit, all such additional costs shall be paid by the applicant-depositor to the City upon demand.</full_text><order_by>06.2</order_by><ancestry><unit id="51" label="article"><name>Public Transportation</name><identifier>1</identifier><url>/7/1/</url></unit><unit id="50" label="chapter"><name>Transporation</name><identifier>7</identifier><url>/7/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="699"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.00</section_number><catch_line>Scope And Definitions.</catch_line><url>/71.00/</url><token>71.00</token></unit><unit id="2322"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.01</section_number><catch_line>Authority Of Board To Adopt Rules.</catch_line><url>/71.01/</url><token>71.01</token></unit><unit id="239"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.01.1</section_number><catch_line>Authority Of Designated Employees Of The Department Of Transportation To Make Arrests And Issue Citations.</catch_line><url>/71.01.1/</url><token>71.01.1</token></unit><unit id="3617"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.01.2</section_number><catch_line>Authority Of Designated Employees Of The Department Of Transportation To Have Access To Local Summary Criminal History Information.</catch_line><url>/71.01.2/</url><token>71.01.2</token></unit><unit id="3076"><structure_id>51</structure_id><section_number>71.02</section_number><catch_line>Operation Of Vehicles &#x2013;
