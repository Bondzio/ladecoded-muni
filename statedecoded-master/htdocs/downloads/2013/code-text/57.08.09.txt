RECOVERY OF COSTS FOR SPECIAL INSPECTIONS. (§ 57.08.09)

  RECOVERY OF COSTS FOR SPECIAL INSPECTIONS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)	A nuisance exists when a business
handles a hazardous substance that has not been disclosed on a Hazardous
Materials and Hazardous Waste Inventory Form or as otherwise required by this
division.  If a business is not in compliance and a special inspection is
needed to obtain information required by this division concerning hazardous
substances handled by the business, the City, after due notice, may conduct a
special inspection and may thereafter recover the costs of the inspection,
together with any administrative costs and the fee for issuance of a Permit. 
All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall be a personal obligation
against the owner of the business and the owner of the property, jointly and
severally, and shall be recoverable by the City in an action before any court of
competent jurisdiction.  In addition to this personal obligation and all other
remedies provided by law, the City may collect any judgment, fee, cost, or
charge, including any permit fees, fines, late charges, or interest, incurred in
relation to the provisions of this section as provided in Los Angeles
Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.
