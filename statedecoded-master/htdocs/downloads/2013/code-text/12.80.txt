12.80)

  HOMELESS SHELTERS – EMERGENCIES – GOVERNMENT OWNED AND LEASED PROPERTY.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 168,440, Eff. 1/31/93.)	Notwithstanding any provisions of
this article to the contrary, during any period or periods, not totaling more
than 120 days between November 1 and March 31, for which the Mayor and/or the
City Council has declared a shelter crisis within the meaning of Government Code
Section 8698, et seq., a shelter for the homeless (as defined in Section 12.03
of this Code) may be established and operated on property owned or leased by a
government agency in any zone as a matter of right without regard to the number
of beds or number of persons served.  The precise location of each such shelter
shall be subject to approval by the City Council.  Prior to Council action,
notice of a public hearing before the Council shall be mailed to the owners of
all properties abutting, across the street or alley from or sharing a common
corner with the subject property at least seven days prior to Council
consideration of the matter.  If the lot on which any such shelter is located
does not have sufficient area to provide the number of parking spaces required
by Section 12.21A4 (w) of this Code, then the number of spaces required shall be
the number for which adequate area exists.  If insufficient area for any
parking spaces exists on the lot, no spaces shall be required.
