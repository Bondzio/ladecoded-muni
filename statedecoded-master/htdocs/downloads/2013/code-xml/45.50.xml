	(Added by Ord. No. 153,406,Eff. 3/8/80.)

	After public hearing and receipt of testimony, the City Council finds and declares:

	That arbitrary discrimination against tenants on the basis of age, parenthood, pregnancy, and potential or actual tenancy of a minor child exists in the City of Los Angeles;

	That the existence of such discrimination poses a substantial threat to the public health and welfare of large segments of the population;

	That there is a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the City of Los Angeles, resulting in a critically low vacancy factor;

	That such discrimination has an overall detrimental effect upon the composition of the City, that it encourages the flight of families from the City of Los Angeles, and results in the decline of stable, intergenerational neighborhoods, the preservation of family life within the City, and the reduction of social and recreational services for children and their families;

	That such discrimination cuts across all racial, ethnic, and economic lines, and falls most heavily on minority and single parent families with children;

	That it is consistent with the Housing Element of the General Plan to promote and ensure equal opportunities for all persons regardless of age or family composition in rental housing in the City;

	That because housing is a fundamental necessity of life, it is against the public policy of the City of Los Angeles to discriminate in rental housing upon the basis of age, parenthood, pregnancy, or the potential or actual tenancy of a minor child.</full_text><order_by>50</order_by><text><unit id="3557" prefix=""><text>&#xA0; FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

	(Added by Ord. No. 153,406,Eff. 3/8/80.)

	After public hearing and receipt of testimony, the City Council finds and
declares:

	That arbitrary discrimination against tenants on the basis of age, parenthood,
pregnancy, and potential or actual tenancy of a minor child exists in the City
of Los Angeles;

	That the existence of such discrimination poses a substantial threat to the
public health and welfare of large segments of the population;

	That there is a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the City of
Los Angeles, resulting in a critically low vacancy factor;

	That such discrimination has an overall detrimental effect upon the composition
of the City, that it encourages the flight of families from the City of Los
Angeles, and results in the decline of stable, intergenerational neighborhoods,
the preservation of family life within the City, and the reduction of social and
recreational services for children and their families;

	That such discrimination cuts across all racial, ethnic, and economic lines,
and falls most heavily on minority and single parent families with children;

	That it is consistent with the Housing Element of the General Plan to promote
and ensure equal opportunities for all persons regardless of age or family
composition in rental housing in the City;
