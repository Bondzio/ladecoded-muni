  CONTACT WITH TENANTS.
	(Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)	The Department may contact the
tenants of any property before or after placement into REAP.  This contact may
be in person or by mail or by both, and the Department may contract with other
persons or organizations to carry out this activity.  During this contact, the
tenants shall be informed of the principal provisions of REAP, of the mechanism
for payment into the escrow account by tenants of untenantable residential units
where the building is accepted into REAP, and of their legal rights with respect
to eviction and rent increases under the provisions of this article and the RSO.
