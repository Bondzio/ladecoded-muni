91.6109)

  SWIMMING POOLS AND OTHER BODIES OF WATER – PROTECTIVE DEVICES REQUIRED.
	(Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper.
1/1/08.)	(a)	Fences.  Every swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water,
which contains water 18 inches or more in depth, shall be enclosed by a fence,
the height of which, including gates, shall be not less than four and one-half
feet above the ground.  Gates shall be self-latching with the latch located
four and one-half feet minimum above the ground.  However, for new swimming
pools or spas, the height and construction of the fence and gate shall comply
with the requirements of Division 31, whichever is more restrictive and provide
greater safety.	Where the ground surface on the side of the fence away from the
body of water slopes upward, four and one-half feet clearance shall be
maintained between the fence and the face of the slope.	In lieu of maintaining a
fence, the owner may provide a competent person who shall keep the pool under
observation at all times while water is kept in the pool.	EXCEPTION:  The
provisions of this section shall not apply to oceans, lakes, rivers, streams and
similar bodies of water, which are publicly owned over which the State of
California of the City or County of Los Angeles has control and
jurisdiction.	(b)	Existing Body of Water.  The provisions of this section shall
also apply to all existing bodies of water.
