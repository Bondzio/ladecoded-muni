REFUSAL OF A TENANT TO PAY. (§ 151.11)

  REFUSAL OF A TENANT TO PAY.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)	A.	A tenant may
refuse to pay any rent in excess of the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent
permitted pursuant to this chapter or regulations or orders adopted hereunder or
as further permitted by this chapter or by ordinance.  The fact that such rent
is in excess of maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent shall be a defense in any
action brought to recover possession of a rental unit or to collect the illegal
rent.  This subsection shall not be applicable to any rental unit not subject
to the restrictions on rent set forth in this chapter.	B.	A tenant may withhold
the payment of any rent otherwise lawfully due and owing after July 1, 1979,
until such time as the landlord has complied with Section 151.04 C. and Section
151.05 A. of this Chapter.  Once the landlord has complied with Sections 151.04
C. and 151.05 A. of this Chapter, the tenant becomes obligated to pay the
current rent and any back rent withheld pursuant to this Subsection.  (Amended
by Ord. 182,359, Eff. 1/26/13.)
