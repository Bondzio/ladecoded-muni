Storm water NPDES Construction Permit or local ordinance, whichever is stricter,
as is required for projects over one acre. The plan should cover prevention of
soil loss by storm water run-off and/or wind erosion, of sedimentation, and/or
of dust/particulate matter air pollution.
        A5.106.2  Storm water design.  Design storm water runoff rate and

water management plan resulting in no net increase in rate and quantity of storm
water runoff from existing to developed conditions.
        EXCEPTION:  If the site is already greater than 50 percent impervious,
implement a storm water management plan resulting in a 25 percent decrease in
rate and quantity.
        A5.106.2.2  Storm water runoff quality.  Use post construction
treatment control best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate (infiltrate,
filter, or treat) storm water runoff from the 85th percentile 24-hour runoff
event (for volume-based BMPs) or the runoff produced by a rain event equal to
two times the 85th percentile hourly intensity (for flow-based BMPs).
