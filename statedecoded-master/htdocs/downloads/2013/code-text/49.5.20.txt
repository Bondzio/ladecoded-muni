LATE FILING PENALTIES. (§ 49.5.20)

  LATE FILING PENALTIES.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 170,538, Eff. 7/13/95.)	If any person files an original
statement or report after any deadline imposed by this article, he or she shall,
in addition to any other penalties or remedies established by the article, be
liable to the City in the amount of twenty five dollars ($25) per day after the
deadline until the statement or report is filed. Liability need not be enforced
by the City if the Commission on an impartial basis determines that the late
filing was not willful and that enforcement of the liability will not further
the purposes of the article, except that no liability shall be waived if a
statement or report is not filed within 30 days.
