	(Amended by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9/28/12.)

	An applicant requiring issuance of a permit to connect to or construct a Special House Connection Sewer or Bonded Sewer House Connection Sewer must file an application with the Bureau of Engineering.&#xA0; The Bureau shall charge and collect, in addition to all other required fees and charges, the following fee where applicable:

	(a)	For rectangular lots, a fee of $72 for each linear foot of the lot frontage for which the connection or construction is sought, except that for rectangular lots that have multiple frontages providing access to sewers, a fee of $72 for each linear foot of the shortest frontage.

	(b)	For lots that are not rectangular, the Bureau shall calculate the area of the lot for which the connection or construction is sought, determine the size of a rectangular lot that would be equal in area, and impose a fee of $72 for each linear foot of frontage of the equivalent rectangular lot.

	(c)	The Bureau of Engineering may reduce the total fee imposed pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (a) or (b) of this Section where it determines that the fee would exceed the fee amount charged with respect to other lots in the same bonded sewer area.

	(d)	The provisions of this Section do not apply to permit applications for a Bonded Sewer House Connection Sewer where the lot for which the connection is sought was the subject of an assessment for a public sewer connection at the front, rear or side of the lot.

	Fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be deposited into the Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund established pursuant to the provisions of Section 64.19.2.</full_text><order_by>18</order_by><ancestry><unit id="41" label="article"><name>Sewers, Water Courses And Drains</name><identifier>4</identifier><url>/6/4/</url></unit><unit id="5" label="chapter"><name>Public Works and Property</name><identifier>6</identifier><url>/6/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="1060"><structure_id>41</structure_id><section_number>64.03</section_number><catch_line>
