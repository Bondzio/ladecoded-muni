For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa.
a.	40d box nails shall be permitted to be substituted for 16d common nails.
b.	Nailing requirements shall be permitted to be reduced 25 percent if nails are clinched.
c.	Heel joint connections are not required when the ridge is supported by a load-bearing wall, header or ridge beam.
d.	When immediate support of the rafter is provided by vertical struts or purlins to a load-bearing wall, the tabulated heel joint connection requirements shall be permitted to be reduced proportionally to the reduction in span.
e.	Equivalent nailing patterns are required for ceiling joists to ceiling joist lap splices.
f.	When rafter ties are substituted for ceiling joists, the heel joint connection requirement shall be taken as the tabulate heel joint connection requirement for two-thirds of the actual rafter slope.
g.	Applies to roof live load of 20 psf or less.
h.	Tabulated heel joint connection requirements assume that ceiling joists or rafter ties are located at the bottom of the attic space.&#xA0; When ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic, heel joint connection requirements shall be increased by the following factors:

	where:
	Hc = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.
	Hg = Height of the roof ridge measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.

91.5.802.8. Lateral Support.&#xA0; Roof framing members and ceiling joists having a depth-to-thickness ratio exceeding 2 to 1 based on nominal dimensions shall be provided with lateral support at points of bearing to prevent rotation.&#xA0; For roof rafters with ceiling joists attached per Table R602.3(1), the depth-thickness ratio for the total assembly shall be determined using the combined thickness of the rafter plus the attached ceiling joist.

91.5.802.10.2. Design.&#xA0; Wood trusses shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice.&#xA0; The design and manufacture of metal-plate-connected wood trusses shall comply with ANSI/TPI 1.&#xA0; The truss design drawings shall be prepared by a registered professional.

91.5.803.2.4. Openings in Horizontal Diaphragms.&#xA0; Openings in horizontal diaphragms shall conform to Section 91.R503.2.4.&#xA0;</full_text><order_by>5.800</order_by><text><unit id="1201" prefix=""><text>&#xA0;

a.	40d box nails shall be permitted to be substituted for 16d common nails.
b.	Nailing requirements shall be permitted to be reduced 25 percent if nails are clinched.
c.	Heel joint connections are not required when the ridge is supported by a load-bearing wall, header or ridge beam.
d.	When immediate support of the rafter is provided by vertical struts or purlins to a load-bearing wall, the tabulated heel joint connection requirements shall be permitted to be reduced proportionally to the reduction in span.
e.	Equivalent nailing patterns are required for ceiling joists to ceiling joist lap splices.
f.	When rafter ties are substituted for ceiling joists, the heel joint connection requirement shall be taken as the tabulate heel joint connection requirement for two-thirds of the actual rafter slope.
g.	Applies to roof live load of 20 psf or less.
h.	Tabulated heel joint connection requirements assume that ceiling joists or rafter ties are located at the bottom of the attic space.&#xA0; When ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic, heel joint connection requirements shall be increased by the following factors:

	where:
	Hc = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.
	Hg = Height of the roof ridge measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.

91.5.802.8. Lateral Support.&#xA0; Roof framing members and ceiling joists having a depth-to-thickness ratio exceeding 2 to 1 based on nominal dimensions shall be provided with lateral support at points of bearing to prevent rotation.&#xA0; For roof rafters with ceiling joists attached per Table R602.3(1), the depth-thickness ratio for the total assembly shall be determined using the combined thickness of the rafter plus the attached ceiling joist.

91.5.802.10.2. Design.&#xA0; Wood trusses shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice.&#xA0; The design and manufacture of metal-plate-connected wood trusses shall comply with ANSI/TPI 1.&#xA0; The truss design drawings shall be prepared by a registered professional.

kPa.
a.	40d box nails shall be permitted to be substituted for 16d common nails.
b.	Nailing requirements shall be permitted to be reduced 25 percent if nails are
clinched.
c.	Heel joint connections are not required when the ridge is supported by a
load-bearing wall, header or ridge beam.
d.	When immediate support of the rafter is provided by vertical struts or
purlins to a load-bearing wall, the tabulated heel joint connection requirements
shall be permitted to be reduced proportionally to the reduction in span.
e.	Equivalent nailing patterns are required for ceiling joists to ceiling joist
lap splices.
f.	When rafter ties are substituted for ceiling joists, the heel joint
connection requirement shall be taken as the tabulate heel joint connection
requirement for two-thirds of the actual rafter slope.
g.	Applies to roof live load of 20 psf or less.
h.	Tabulated heel joint connection requirements assume that ceiling joists or
rafter ties are located at the bottom of the attic space.&#xA0; When ceiling joists
or rafter ties are located higher in the attic, heel joint connection
requirements shall be increased by the following factors:


  
    
      
        Hc / Hg
      
      
        Heel Joint Connection Adjustment Factor

	where:
	Hc = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically above the top
of the rafter support walls.
	Hg = Height of the roof ridge measured vertically above the top of the rafter
support walls.

91.5.802.8. Lateral Support.&#xA0; Roof framing members and ceiling joists having a
depth-to-thickness ratio exceeding 2 to 1 based on nominal dimensions shall be
provided with lateral support at points of bearing to prevent rotation.&#xA0; For
roof rafters with ceiling joists attached per Table R602.3(1), the
depth-thickness ratio for the total assembly shall be determined using the
combined thickness of the rafter plus the attached ceiling joist.

91.5.802.10.2. Design.&#xA0; Wood trusses shall be designed in accordance with
accepted engineering practice.&#xA0; The design and manufacture of
metal-plate-connected wood trusses shall comply with ANSI/TPI 1.&#xA0; The truss
design drawings shall be prepared by a registered professional.

91.5.803.2.4. Openings in Horizontal Diaphragms.&#xA0; Openings in horizontal
diaphragms shall conform to Section 91.R503.2.4.&#xA0;
