The average single-family residential parcel has an area of 0.1526 acres (6,650 square feet) and a run-off factor of 0.4176. The product of these (0.0637) is defined as the Basic Assessment Unit.

	(l)	&#x201C;Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU)&#x201D; &#x2013; The number of Basic Assessment Units a particular parcel represents and is determined using the following formula:



	(m)	&#x201C;Base Charge&#x201D; &#x2013; The fee/charge paid by the average single-family residential parcel owner.
