	A.	After receiving notice that all orders have been complied with and all violations have been corrected, including but not limited to those that caused the placement into REAP and any subsequent orders or violations, the Department may recommend to the City Council the termination of the rent reductions if it finds:

	C.	The Department may recommend termination of the escrow account if, in addition to the findings in Subsection A or B, it finds that any outstanding and non-appealable electric service and/or water charges pertaining to the property have been paid to the satisfaction of the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles.

As a condition of terminating the escrow account, the City Council may order an expedited systematic inspection pursuant to Section 161.805(6) and impose inspection fees and administrative costs pursuant to Sections 161.901 through 161.903.&#xA0; The City Council may also condition termination of the escrow account on payment of those fees or any other unpaid fees under Subsection D.
