BOND OR INSURANCE POLICY. (§ 68.10)

  BOND OR INSURANCE POLICY.	(a)	No permit shall be issued pursuant to this
section unless the applicant shall post and maintain with the Board a surety
bond or policy of public liability insurance, approved by the Board and
conditioned as hereinafter provided.	(b)	The bond or policy shall be conditioned
that the permittee will indemnify and save harmless the City of Los Angeles, its
officers and employees from any and all loss, costs, damages, expenses or
liability which may result from or arise out of the granting of the permit, or
the installation or maintenance of the bench for which the permit is issued and
that the permittee will pay any and all loss or damage that may be sustained by
any person as a result of, or which may be caused by or arise out of such
installation or maintenance. The bond or policy of insurance shall be maintained
in its original amount by the permittee at his expense at all times during the
period for which the permit is in effect. In the event that two or more permits
are issued to one permittee, one such bond or policy of insurance may be
furnished to cover two or more benches, and each bond or policy shall be of such
a type that its coverage shall be automatically restored immediately from and
after the time of the reporting of any accident from which liability may
thereafter accrue.
