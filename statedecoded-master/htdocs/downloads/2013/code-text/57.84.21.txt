  BATCH PROCESS OVENS.	Dipped materials in batch process ovens shall require a
minimum rate of exhaust ventilation of 380 cfm (referred to 70°F.) per gallon
flammable volatiles in the batch.	A.	All exhaust from the oven shall be by
mechanical means using power driven fans or blowers which shall operate
continuously while the oven is in operation.	B.	Each oven shall be equipped with
individual exhaust systems not connected to exhausts serving other
equipment.	EXCEPTION:	Ovens which are divided into several small compartments or
groups of small individual ovens may be exhausted by a common exhaust fan if
approved by the Chief.  Ovens shall have the ventilation fans electrically
interlocked in such a manner as to prevent operation of the heating units unless
the exhaust fans are running.
