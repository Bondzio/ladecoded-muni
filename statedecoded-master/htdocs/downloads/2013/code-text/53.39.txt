	(Amended by Ord. No. 133,983, Eff. 4/10/67.)	The Department is hereby invested
with the authority to issue permits to any person for the keeping or maintaining
of any wild, exotic, dangerous or non-domestic animal or reptile when, in the
opinion of the General Manager, any such animal or reptile may be kept or
maintained without menacing the safety of any person or property; provided,
however, that the Department may require any such animal or reptile to be
properly caged or secured or may make additional rules or regulations regulating
the keeping or maintaining of any such animal or reptile, and may revoke any
such permit for any violation of any of the provisions of this article or of any
of the rules and regulations of the Department, or when, in the opinion of the
General Manager, the safety of any person or property is menaced by the keeping
of any such animal or reptile.	Provided further, that the Department shall also
have authority to issue permits for the keeping or maintaining, on a temporary
basis, of all types of wild animals or reptiles in connection with a circus,
amusement enterprise or animal exhibition when located in a zone wherein such
uses are permitted pursuant to Article 2, Chapter I of this Code.	Revocation of
permits shall follow the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.02 of this Code.
