specific plan established before or after the effective date of this ordinance.\u00a0 Each ordinance creating an MPR District shall establish one or more of the strategies listed in Subsection D. for the District area.\n\n\tB.\tSize and Boundaries.\u00a0 An MPR District shall encompass a minimum of two entire block faces (as defined in Section 13.09 B.3. of this Code) or a minimum of five acres in area.\u00a0 The boundaries of the MPR District shall be set by ordinance.\n\n\tC.\tFindings.\u00a0 In making the report required by Section 12.32 C.2. of this Code, the City Planning Commission shall also report to the Council on whether the District, and the strategies included in the District, are appropriate considering such factors as local transit service and dependency, automobile usage, traffic, available parking, and the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the applicable community plan.\n\n\tD.\tModified Parking Requirement (MPR) District Strategies.\u00a0 Any ordinance creating an MPR District shall adopt one or more of the seven strategies listed in this subsection for the MPR District area.\n\n\t1.\tChange of Use Parking Standards.\u00a0 The required number of parking spaces for any permitted use in the District shall be the same as the number of spaces that exist on the lot on the date the ordinance creating the District becomes effective.\n\n\t2.\tOff-site Parking.\u00a0 The\u00a0 parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. of this Code shall be provided either on the same lot as the use for which they are intended to serve or 1,500 feet therefrom.\u00a0 If parking spaces are provided off-site, they must be guaranteed through a recorded covenant agreement that reserves the spaces exclusively for the use in question.\u00a0 Distance is to be measured along any street, alley, public walk, or private easement that allows public pedestrian travel from the parking area to the use it is to serve.\n\n\t3.\tParking Reduction Approval.\u00a0 A Zoning Administrator may approve reduced parking requirements for individual projects pursuant to Section 12.24 X.30. of this Code.\n\n\t4.\tDecreased Parking Requirements.\u00a0 An MPR District may establish parking requirements that are less restrictive than those set forth in Section 12.21 A.4. of this Code.\u00a0 The ordinance creating the District shall identify each use that is granted modified parking requirements, along with each use\u2019s new parking requirement.\u00a0 Otherwise, the number of required parking spaces shall be governed by Section 12.21 A.4.\u00a0 Before adopting any ordinance creating an MPR District that includes Decreased Parking Requirements, the City Council must find that:\n\n\ta.\tThe parking reduction, taking into account impacts such as parking overflow and increased traffic congestion and potential benefits such as enhanced mobility and neighborhood vitality, will not adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood; and\n\n\tb.\tThere exists a combination of parking management programs, transportation alternatives, or other infrastructure improvements, and commercial building access programs that negate the need for increased parking requirements; and\n\n\tc.\tFlexible transportation approaches and parking management programs are more consistent with the area\u2019s air quality goals, community character and general plan than an increased number of required parking spaces.\n\n\t5.\tIncreased Parking Requirements.\u00a0 An MPR District may establish parking requirements that are more restrictive than those required in Paragraph 12.21 A.4. of this Code.\u00a0 The ordinance creating the District shall identify each use that is assigned increased parking requirements, along with each use\u2019s new parking requirement.\u00a0 Otherwise, the number of required spaces shall be governed by Section 12.21 A.4.\u00a0 Before adopting any ordinance creating an MPR District that includes Increased Parking Requirements, the City Council must find that:\n\n\ta.\tThere is a lack of transit service in the area; or\n\n\tb.\tThere is a high potential for spillover parking impacts on adjacent residential areas; or\n\n\tc.\tThere is a low probability that parking management programs, transportation demand management programs, or public parking facilities will be available or effective in the area.\n\n\t6.\tCommercial Parking Credits.\u00a0 An MPR District may authorize parking requirements to be satisfied through the creation of a parking credit program.\u00a0 The number of available parking credits shall be established by a survey that identifies the number of underutilized public parking spaces available within the District at various times of the day.\u00a0 The ordinance creating the District shall list the number of credits available in the area, and the number of credits required to support a specific use for various times of the day.\n\n\t7.\tMaximum Parking Requirements.\u00a0 An MPR District may establish maximum parking requirements.\u00a0 The ordinance creating the District shall set forth each use for which maximum parking requirements apply, as well as the specific parking limits for that use.\u00a0 Otherwise, the parking requirements set forth in Section 12.21 A.4. shall apply.\n\n\tE.\tApplicability of Modified Parking Strategies to Residential Uses.\u00a0 This Section shall apply to lots where the zoning regulations permit multi-residential uses as follows:\n\n\t1.\tAn MPR District shall not authorize any of the strategies listed above, except for the strategies described in subsections D.5. and D.6., for any lot that contained a residential use subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, or that contained any Restricted Affordable units, as defined in Section 12.22 A.25.(b) of the Code, within the five years preceding the adoption of the MPR District.\u00a0 Required parking on such properties, however, may be reduced pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25. of the Code, or pursuant to any other applicable affordable housing incentive program.\n\n\t2.\tMinimum parking requirements
