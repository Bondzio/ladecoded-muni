No. 142,081, Eff. 7\/22\/71.)\n\n\tThe following regulations shall apply to the SL Ocean Submerged Land Zone:\n\n\tA.\tNature, Scope and Purpose.\u00a0 The Los Angeles City seacoast and off\u00a0 shore water and underwater areas constitute a unique and important geographical and scenic resource, utilized for shipping, industry, commerce, residence and recreation.\n\n\tOffshore zoning and incidental districts are a related and appropriate extension of city planning and zoning principles and practices on land. Their basic purpose is to protect all users of affected land from the recognized problems and depreciation brought about by unregulated development. Particular purposes in Los Angeles include\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 protection of the recreational, residential and scenic uses of coast areas, now much in demand for these uses and with greater demand forecast for the future;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 preservation of the near seaward prospect of residential zones along the coast, where this outlook constitutes part of the environment and value of overlooking onshore properties and\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 provision for such other uses as benefit the public and City without significant impairment of these recreational and residential uses.\n\n\tTo permit new coastline or offshore developments of conflicting type which are not essential to the public interest and could jeopardize or downgrade existing recreational and residential users, would not constitute proper consideration of public necessity, convenience, general welfare and good zoning practice.\n\n\tTo realize the purposes enumerated above, in accordance with established city planning principles, practice and supportive zoning, certain general objectives must be met and certain specific requirements are normally necessary for the constructive control of offshore activities, whether achieved by zone change, variance, special district or otherwise.\n\n\t1.\tThere must be no chemical and biological contamination, visual clouding or soiling of urban coastline, beaches or offshore waters by industrial\/commercial uses.\n\n\t2.\tInstallations onshore, temporary or relatively permanent, must be of such size, nature, location and spacing that they do not significantly interfere with or adversely affect the residential and recreational use, operation, environment or enjoyment of coastline and offshore areas.\n\n\t3.\tThe preservation of urban coastline and offshore areas, above and below water level, in the natural state or for recreation and residence, should take precedence if their function and enjoyment are threatened by additional potentially conflicting offshore uses which are not clearly of greater public necessity and interest.\n\n\t4.\tAny shoreline industrial\/commercial uses should be of limited and designated duration, with provision for complete removal of installations and restoration of the prior or natural state after expiration of the permissible time period, unless such removal and restoration are unnecessary to maintain desirable recreational and residential environment.\n\n\t5.\tNo industrial\/commercial operations should be undertaken where or when they may cause significant alterations to the underlying geologic stability of other areas, offshore and onshore, or otherwise bring about undesirable changes of basic topographical condition.\n\n\t6.\tPiers, jetties, causeways, man-made islands, bridges or other connective structures should be prohibited, except when they enhance the recreational\/residential environment.\n\n\t7.\tEmission of smoke, steam, chemical, odor, sound, artificial light of other form of atmospheric pollutant or environmental impairment from any seaside industrial\/commercial installation or facility should be controlled to fulfill the purposes of this zoning.\n\n\t8.\tNo provision of offshore urban zoning should conflict with state, federal or international rights or control established by law within the same geographical areas.\n\n\tB.\tUse.\u00a0 No property of any kind shall be used except for the following uses or when a Supplemental Use District is created by the provisions of Article 3 of this chapter, provided, however, that in no event shall any property be used for surface-type operations (either above or below water level) relating to oil drilling and production of oil, gas or hydrocarbons.\n\n\t1.\tNavigation\n\n\t2.\tThe following uses when conducted in accordance with the limitations hereafter specified:\n\n\t(a)\tTypes of Uses:\n\n\t(1)\tCommercial Shipping;\n\n\t(2)\tFishing;\n\n\t(3)\tRecreation;\n\n\t(4)\tAny use required by any trust or legislative grant to the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\t(b)\tLimitations.\u00a0 (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10\/10\/00.)\u00a0 No piers, jetties, man-made islands, floating installations or the like are permitted in connection with any of the above uses unless authorized under the provisions of Section 12.24U.","order_by":"20.1","ancestry":{"1":{"id":"20","name":"Specific Planning \u2013 Zoning\nComprehensive Zoning
