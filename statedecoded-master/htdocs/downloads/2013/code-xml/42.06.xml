	(a)	No person shall solicit custom or patronage for any purpose for or on behalf of himself or any other person in any railroad or automobile stage depot or grounds.

	(b)	No person shall stand or park any vehicle owned, operated or under the control of said person in any railroad or automobile stage depot, grounds or premises.

	(c)	The provisions of this section shall not apply to any person who, with the written consent of the owner, lessee or managing agent of said railroad or automobile stage depot, park or stand any vehicle used or intended for use in transporting persons or property to or from such depot, grounds or premises; nor to persons maintaining booths for the information, accommodation or convenience of the traveling public with the written consent of the owner, lessee or managing agent of such railroad or automobile stage depot.

	The provisions of this subsection shall not be regarded as soliciting within the meaning of this section.

	An ordinance which prohibits solicitation of patronage for transportation in or about a depot without consent of the owner does not constitute unlawful discrimination between persons who have and others who have not such consent, and is valid.

consent of the owner, lessee or managing agent of said railroad or automobile
stage depot, park or stand any vehicle used or intended for use in transporting
persons or property to or from such depot, grounds or premises; nor to persons

shall not be regarded as soliciting within the meaning of this section.	An
ordinance which prohibits solicitation of patronage for transportation in or
about a depot without consent of the owner does not constitute unlawful
discrimination between persons who have and others who have not such consent,
