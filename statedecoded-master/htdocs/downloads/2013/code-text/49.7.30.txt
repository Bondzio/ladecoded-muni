MATCHING FUNDS PAYMENTS TO CANDIDATES. (§ 49.7.30)

  MATCHING FUNDS PAYMENTS TO CANDIDATES.	A.	The Ethics Commission shall certify
each request for matching funds payment within three business days after
receiving the request.	B.	The Controller shall make matching funds payments in
the amount certified by the Ethics Commission within two business days after
receiving the certification from the Ethics Commission.	C.	Except for the
general election grant, a matching funds payment may not be made before the
Ethics Commission determines the sufficiency of the Public Matching Funds Trust
Fund under Administrative Code Section 24.33.  If the Ethics Commission
determines that the balance of the Public Matching Funds Trust Fund is not or
may not be sufficient to pay the maximum matching funds to all qualified
participating candidates, the Commission shall notify the Controller to withhold
amounts sufficient to ensure that each qualified participating candidate will
receive a pro rata share of the applicable maximum.  The amounts withheld will
be paid if the Ethics Commission subsequently determines that there is
sufficient money to pay the maximum matching funds.
