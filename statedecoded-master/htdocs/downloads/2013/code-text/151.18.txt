ADDITIONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS. (§ 151.18)

  ADDITIONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS.	A landlord and tenant may enter into a
contract for the provision of any housing service which was not a part of the
original terms of the tenancy. A valid additional services contract must be
written, and must describe each additional service, specify the period of time
for which the additional service will be provided, and the monthly charge for
the service.  Termination of the tenancy shall also terminate the additional
services contract.  Any monies paid pursuant to an additional services contract
shall not be considered rent for any purpose under this chapter. Neither the
refusal of a tenant to enter into an additional services contract, nor the
breach of such contract shall be a ground for termination of the tenancy.
