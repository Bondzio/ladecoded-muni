SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR NITRATE AND NITRITE BATHS. (§ 57.60.08)

  SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR NITRATE AND NITRITE BATHS.	A.	Contamination of the
Bath:	1.	No salt containing cyanide shall be added to a nitrate
bath.	2.	Magnesium and its alloys shall not be heat treated in nitrate
baths.	B.	Heating of the Bath:	1.	Solid fuels shall not be used to heat nitrate
or nitrite baths.	2.	Baths that are externally heated by gas or oil burners
shall be so located that the heat will be uniformly distributed without flame
impingement on the pot.  Burners shall be arranged so that in the event of
rupture of the pot molten salts cannot come in contact with highly heated
materials or enter into the combustion chamber.	3.	When nitrate or nitrite baths
are taken out of service or shut off, the salt shall be removed before it
solidifies, or steel rods shall be immersed in the solution to provide vent
holes for gases to escape and prevent blowout of gas pockets when
reheating.	4.	Excess temperature controls on nitrate or nitrite salt baths shall
be set no higher than 1,000°F
