MANIFOLD CONSTRUCTION. (§ 57.41.20)

  MANIFOLD CONSTRUCTION.	A.	The design of, and materials for, stationary
manifolds shall be suitable for the gases and liquids with which they are to be
used.	B.	Stationary manifolds shall be designed for a rupture strength of five
times the maximum pressure to which the connected container will be subjected at
115° F., but in no case more than 10,000 psig, nor less than 1,000 psig for
nonliquefied material nor less than 500 psig for liquefied
materials.	C.	Manifolds shall be rigid, well supported, and shall be adequately
protected against injury.	D.	Stationary manifolds shall be tested and shall be
gas tight at the pressure at which the manifold will be operated.	E.	Portable
containers connected to a manifold shall be set on a firm, non-combustible
foundation. Noncombustible supports shall be provided for securing cylinders
against excessive movement or overturning which might damage piping or
connections.	F.	No person shall use a manifold or appurtenant equipment for any
gas or liquid other than that for which it was designed.	G.	Pig tails or other
approved flexible connectors shall be used to connect cylinders to the manifold
header.
