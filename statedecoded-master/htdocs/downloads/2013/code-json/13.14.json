welfare, and to assure compliance with the objectives of the General Plan and the purpose and intent of the CPIO District.\u00a0 An exception from a CPIO regulation shall not be used to grant a special privilege, nor to grant relief from self-imposed hardships.\n\n\t(b)\tFindings.\u00a0 The Area Planning Commission may permit an exception from a CPIO regulation not involving signage if it makes all the following findings:\n\n\t(i)\tThe strict application of the CPIO regulations to the subject property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the
