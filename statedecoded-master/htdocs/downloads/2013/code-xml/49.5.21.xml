	(New Sec. 49.5.21 Added by Ord. No. 171,142, Eff. 8/3/96.)

	A.	Applicability.

	1.	This section is applicable if the City Ethics Commission makes a finding that a person has laundered campaign funds in violation of Charter Section 470(k), and that finding is made after an administrative enforcement hearing pursuant to Charter Section 706 or as a result of a stipulation between the person committing the violation and the City Ethics Commission.&#xA0; (Charter Section Nos. Amended by Ord. No. 172,942, Eff. 1/21/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)

	2.	This section is applicable to the following contracts awarded or fees waived by the City Council or by any City agency, excluding the following proprietary City departments: Airports, City Employees Retirement System, Harbor, Library, Pensions, Recreation and Parks, and Water and Power:

	(a)	all contracts for personal services, and to all other contracts involving a contract price in an amount of $1,000 or more;

	(b)	all discretionary fee waivers of $1,000 or more.

	3.	This section is applicable only to violations committed after the effective date of the ordinance adding this section.

	B.	Competitively Bid Contracts.

	l.	Prior to awarding any contract which is required to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, the City Council or other City board, commission or officer charged with the duty to award the contract (the awarding authority) shall determine whether, the lowest monetary bidder has been found to have committed the violation as specified in Subsection A.1. above within the previous four years.

	2.	The awarding authority shall not award the contract to the lowest monetary bidder, if, following a hearing as described in Subdivision 3. below, it finds that, as a result of the violation, the awarding authority believes that the bidder lacks integrity such that it is unfit to perform the work specified in the contract.&#xA0; The awarding authority shall make that finding unless there are specific facts brought to its attention, in writing, which indicate otherwise.&#xA0; On that basis, the awarding authority shall deem the bidder to be not responsible.

	3.	Prior to making a finding that a bidder is not responsible as set forth in Subdivision 2., the awarding authority shall notify the bidder of its intention to consider making such a finding.&#xA0; The awarding authority shall offer the bidder an opportunity to present evidence and argument that, despite the bidder having been found to have violated the City law prohibiting the laundering of campaign funds, the awarding authority should not have reason to question the bidder&#x2019;s integrity and fitness to perform the contract.&#xA0; If the bidder desires to present such evidence and/or argument to the awarding authority, the awarding authority shall hold an informal hearing.&#xA0; At that hearing the bidder shall be allowed to make a presentation.&#xA0; After having considered the bidder&#x2019;s presentation, and the presentations of any other interested parties, the awarding authority may make the finding set forth in Subdivision 2. if it is satisfied that such a finding is merited.

	C.	Contracts Awarded on a Basis Other Than Competitive Bidding.&#xA0; The City Council or other City board, commission or officer charged with the duty to award a contract shall not approve any contract on behalf of the City, other than a contract required to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, with any party, if the party has been found to have committed the violation as specified in Subsection A.1. above within the previous four years.

	D.	Fee Waivers.&#xA0; The City Council or other City board, commission or officer shall not grant any discretionary waiver of more than $1,000 of any City fee for any person, if the person has been found to have committed the violation as specified in Subsection A.1. above within the previous four years.

	E.	Notice of Violations.

	1.	The City Ethics Commission shall provide a copy of every Commission enforcement decision relating to a violation as specified in Subsection A.1., together with a copy of any stipulation filed in the case, to the general manager or other head of each City agency to which this section applies.

	2.	A person who submits a bid or proposal in connection with any contract or a request for fee waiver with a City agency to which this section applies shall include with the bid, contract proposal or fee waiver documents a copy of the Commission&#x2019;s decision of violation as specified in Subsection A.1. made within the previous four years, together with a copy of any stipulation filed in connection therewith.

	3.	With respect to a decision on a contract or fee waiver considered by the City Council, the City Clerk shall submit a report which contains sufficient information to allow the body to comply with the requirements of those provisions.

	4.	With respect to a decision on a contract or fee waiver considered by a City board or commission, the agency staff shall submit a report which contains sufficient information to allow the body to comply with the requirements of those provisions.

	F.	Time Period of Prohibitions and Notification.&#xA0; If the City Ethics Commission makes a finding that the contracting party has either

	(1)	accepted responsibility for the violation in the form of having entered into a stipulation with the City Ethics Commission in which the party admits the violation, or otherwise exhibits evidence of having accepted such responsibility, or

	(2)	mitigated the wrongdoing by taking prompt remedial or corrective action, then the City Ethics Commission may reduce the time period during which the above prohibitions and notification requirements would apply to a period of not less than one year.&#xA0; Any person who has been found by the City Ethics Commission to have violated Charter Section 470(k) may request such a finding from the Commission.&#xA0; (Charter Section No. Amended by Ord. No. 172,942, Eff. 1/21/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)

	G.	Waiver of Provisions.&#xA0; The City Council by a two- thirds vote of its entire membership may waive any or all of the prohibitions contained in this section if the Council makes a written finding that an overriding public policy consideration justifies entering into the contract or waiving the fee despite the prohibition contained in this section.&#xA0; The finding shall set forth the nature of the overriding public policy consideration and the reason why that consideration justifies the waiver of the prohibition and shall be made only when the waiver is justified by a significant community or financial benefit to the City or if it is necessary to preserve the health, safety or welfare of the public.</full_text><order_by>5.21</order_by><ancestry><unit id="93" label="article"><name>Municipal Ethics And Conflicts Of Interest</name><identifier>9.5</identifier><url>/4/9.5/</url></unit><unit id="11" label="chapter"><name>Public Welfare</name><identifier>4</identifier><url>/4/</url></unit></ancestry><structure_contents><unit id="3582"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.1</section_number><catch_line>Title, Findings And Purposes.</catch_line><url>/49.5.1/</url><token>49.5.1</token></unit><unit id="1305"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.10</section_number><catch_line>Restrictions On Gifts And Travel Expenses.</catch_line><url>/49.5.10/</url><token>49.5.10</token></unit><unit id="1880"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.11</section_number><catch_line>Lobbying Activities Of Current And Former City Officials.</catch_line><url>/49.5.11/</url><token>49.5.11</token></unit><unit id="2267"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.12</section_number><catch_line>Future Employment Of City Officials.</catch_line><url>/49.5.12/</url><token>49.5.12</token></unit><unit id="3323"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.13</section_number><catch_line>Participation Of Elective City Officers And Employees In Governmental Decisions.</catch_line><url>/49.5.13/</url><token>49.5.13</token></unit><unit id="2435"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.14</section_number><catch_line>Application Of Requirements.</catch_line><url>/49.5.14/</url><token>49.5.14</token></unit><unit id="1460"><structure_id>93</structure_id><section_number>49.5.15</section_number><catch_line>Contract Bidder And Proposer Disclosure &#x2013;

	(New Sec. 49.5.21 Added by Ord. No. 171,142, Eff. 8/3/96.)	A.	Applicability.	1.	This section is applicable if the City Ethics Commission makes a finding that a person has laundered campaign funds in violation of Charter Section 470(k), and that finding is made after an administrative enforcement hearing pursuant to Charter Section 706 or as a result of a stipulation between the person committing the violation and the City Ethics Commission.&#xA0; (Charter Section Nos. Amended by Ord. No. 172,942, Eff. 1/21/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)	2.	This section is applicable to the following contracts awarded or fees waived by the City Council or by any City agency, excluding the following proprietary City departments: Airports, City Employees Retirement System, Harbor, Library, Pensions, Recreation and Parks, and Water and Power:	(a)	all contracts for personal services, and to all other contracts involving a contract price in an amount of $1,000 or more;	(b)	all discretionary fee waivers of $1,000 or more.	3.	This section is applicable only to violations committed after the effective date of the ordinance adding this section.	B.	Competitively Bid Contracts.	l.	Prior to awarding any contract which is required to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, the City Council or other City board, commission or officer charged with the duty to award the contract (the awarding authority) shall determine whether, the lowest monetary bidder has been found to have committed the violation as specified in Subsection A.1. above within the previous four years.	2.	The awarding authority shall not award the contract to the lowest monetary bidder, if, following a hearing as described in Subdivision 3. below, it finds that, as a result of the violation, the awarding authority believes that the bidder lacks integrity such that it is unfit to perform the work specified in the contract.&#xA0; The awarding authority shall make that finding unless there are specific facts brought to its attention, in writing, which indicate otherwise.&#xA0; On that basis, the awarding authority shall deem the bidder to be not responsible.	3.	Prior to making a finding that a bidder is not responsible as set forth in Subdivision 2., the awarding authority shall notify the bidder of its intention to consider making such a finding.&#xA0; The awarding authority shall offer the bidder an opportunity to present evidence and argument that, despite the bidder having been found to have violated the City law prohibiting the laundering of campaign funds, the awarding authority should not have reason to question the bidder&#x2019;s integrity and fitness to perform the contract.&#xA0; If the bidder desires to present such evidence and/or argument to the awarding authority, the awarding authority shall hold an informal hearing.&#xA0; At that hearing the bidder shall be allowed to make a presentation.&#xA0; After having considered the bidder&#x2019;s presentation, and the presentations of any other interested parties, the awarding authority may make the finding set forth in Subdivision 2. if it is satisfied that such a finding is merited.	C.	Contracts Awarded on a Basis Other Than Competitive Bidding.&#xA0; The City Council or other City board, commission or officer charged with the duty to award a contract shall not approve any contract on behalf of the City, other than a contract required to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, with any party, if the party has been found to have committed the violation as specified in Subsection A.1. above within the previous four years.	D.	Fee Waivers.&#xA0; The City Council or other City board, commission or officer shall not grant any discretionary waiver of more than $1,000 of any City fee for any person, if the person has been found to have committed the violation as specified in Subsection A.1. above within the previous four years.	E.	Notice of Violations.	1.	The City Ethics Commission shall provide a copy of every Commission enforcement decision relating to a violation as specified in Subsection A.1., together with a copy of any stipulation filed in the case, to the general manager or other head of each City agency to which this section applies.	2.	A person who submits a bid or proposal in connection with any contract or a request for fee waiver with a City agency to which this section applies shall include with the bid, contract proposal or fee waiver documents a copy of the Commission&#x2019;s decision of violation as specified in Subsection A.1. made within the previous four years, together with a copy of any stipulation filed in connection therewith.	3.	With respect to a decision on a contract or fee waiver considered by the City Council, the City Clerk shall submit a report which contains sufficient information to allow the body to comply with the requirements of those provisions.	4.	With respect to a decision on a contract or fee waiver considered by a City board or commission, the agency staff shall submit a report which contains sufficient information to allow the body to comply with the requirements of those provisions.	F.	Time Period of Prohibitions and Notification.&#xA0; If the City Ethics Commission makes a finding that the contracting party has either	(1)	accepted responsibility for the violation in the form of having entered into a stipulation with the City Ethics Commission in which the party admits the violation, or otherwise exhibits evidence of having accepted such responsibility, or	(2)	mitigated the wrongdoing by taking prompt remedial or corrective action, then the City Ethics Commission may reduce the time period during which the above prohibitions and notification requirements would apply to a period of not less than one year.&#xA0; Any person who has been found by the City Ethics Commission to have violated Charter Section 470(k) may request such a finding from the Commission.&#xA0; (Charter Section No. Amended by Ord. No. 172,942, Eff. 1/21/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)	G.	Waiver of Provisions.&#xA0; The City Council by a two- thirds vote of its entire membership may waive any or all of the prohibitions contained in this section if the Council makes a written finding that an overriding public policy consideration justifies entering into the contract or waiving the fee despite the prohibition contained in this section.&#xA0; The finding shall set forth the nature of the overriding public policy consideration and the reason why that consideration justifies the waiver of the prohibition and shall be made only when the waiver is justified by a significant community or financial benefit to the City or if it is necessary to preserve the health, safety or welfare of the public.</text><type>section</type><prefixes><unit></unit></prefixes><entire_prefix></entire_prefix><prefix_anchor></prefix_anchor><level>1</level></unit></text></law>
