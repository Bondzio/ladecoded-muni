	A.	Applicability.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; This section shall apply to the conditional use approvals listed in Subsections U, V and W and to the other similar quasi-judicial approvals listed in Subsection X.&#xA0; These procedures apply only to uses in zones when not permitted by right.

	B.	Application for Permit.&#xA0; To apply for a permit, an applicant shall file an application with the Department of City Planning, on a form provided by the Department, and include all information required by the instructions on the application and the guidelines adopted by the Director of Planning.&#xA0; The Director of Planning shall adopt guidelines which shall be used to determine when an application is deemed complete.

	C.	Initial Decision.&#xA0; Except as otherwise provided in Charter Section 564 and Section 12.36 of this Code, the initial decision on an application shall be made by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission, as prescribed in Subsections U, V, W and X.

	For purposes of this section, the initial decision shall mean approval in whole or in part with or without conditions, or denial of the application.

	D.	Public Hearing and Notice.&#xA0; Upon receipt of a complete application, the initial decision-maker shall set the matter for public hearing at which evidence shall be taken and may conduct the hearing itself or may designate a hearing officer to conduct the hearing.

	The Department shall give notice in all of the following manners:

	1.	Publication.&#xA0; By at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, designated for that purpose by the City Clerk, no less than 24 days prior to the date of hearing; and

	2.	Written Notice.

	(a)	By mailing a written notice no less than 24 days prior to the date of the hearing to the applicant, the owner or owners of the property involved, and to the owners of all property within and outside of the City that is within 500 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved, using for the purpose of notification, the last known name and address of owners as shown on the records of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor.&#xA0; Where all property within the 500-foot radius is under the same ownership as the property involved in the application, the owners of all property that adjoins that ownership, or is separated from it only by a street, alley, public right-of-way or other easement, shall also be notified as set forth above; and&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff. 4/10/11.)

	(b)	By mailing a written notice no less than 24 days prior to the date of the hearing to residential, commercial and industrial occupants of all property within 500 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved.&#xA0; This requirement can be met by mailing the notice to &#x201C;occupant&#x201D;; and

	(c)	If notice pursuant to Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will not result in notice being given to at least 20 different owners of at least 20 different lots other than the subject property, then the 500-foot radius for notification shall be increased in increments of 50 feet until the required number of persons and lots are encompassed within the expanded area.&#xA0; Notification shall then be given to all property owners and occupants within the expanded area.

	3.	Site Posting.&#xA0; By the applicant posting notice of the public hearing in a conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing.&#xA0; If a hearing examiner is designated to conduct the public hearing, then the applicant, in addition to posting notice of the public hearing, shall also post notice of the initial meeting of the decision-making body on the matter.&#xA0; This notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior to the date of the meeting.&#xA0; The Director of Planning may adopt guidelines consistent with this section for the posting of notices if the Director determines that those guidelines are necessary and appropriate.

	E.	Findings for Approval.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)&#xA0; A decision-maker shall not grant a conditional use or other approval specified in Subsections U., V., W., or X. of this Section without finding:

	1.	that the project will enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood or will perform a function or provide a service that is essential or beneficial to the community, city, or region;

	2.	that the project&#x2019;s location, size, height, operations and other significant features will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare, and safety; and

	3.	that the project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan, and any applicable specific plan.

	The decision-maker shall also make any additional findings required by Subsections U., V., W. and X., and shall determine that the project satisfies all applicable requirements in those subsections.

	F.	Conditions of Approval.&#xA0; In approving a project, the decision-maker may impose conditions related to the interests addressed in the findings set forth in Subsection E.&#xA0; The decision may state that the height and area regulations required by other provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to the conditional use approved.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)

	G.	Time to Act.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; The initial decision shall be made within 75 days of the date the application is deemed complete, or within an extended period as mutually agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the decision-maker.&#xA0; An initial decision shall not be considered made until written findings are adopted in accordance with Subsection E. &#xA0; Upon making its decision, the initial decision-maker shall transmit a copy of the written findings and decision to the applicant, to all owners of properties abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner with the subject property and to all persons who have filed a written request for the notice with the Department of City Planning.

	Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, the initial decision-maker shall make its decision on any application for a hazardous waste storage, treatment, or disposal facility, as governed by Subdivisions 10 and 11 of Subsection U of this section, pursuant to the time limits as set forth in Article 8.7 of the California Health and Safety Code.

	H.	Failure to Act &#x2013; Transfer of Jurisdiction.

	1.	If the initial decision-maker fails to act on an application within 75 days from the date of filing a complete application, or within a mutually agreed upon extension of time, the applicant may file a request for a transfer of jurisdiction to the designated appellate body for decision.&#xA0; The designated appellate body is the body to whom the matter would normally be appealable, pursuant to Subsections U, V, W and X.&#xA0; The Director of Planning shall prescribe the form and manner of filing requests for transfers of jurisdiction.

	2.	When the designated appellate body receives the applicant&#x2019;s request for a transfer of jurisdiction, the initial decision-maker shall lose jurisdiction.&#xA0; However, the body to whom the matter is transferred may remand the matter to the initial decision-maker who shall regain jurisdiction for the time and purpose specified in the remand action.&#xA0; In addition, upon receipt of a written request by the applicant for withdrawal of the transfer of jurisdiction prior to the matter being heard by the appellate body, the matter shall be remanded to the initial decision-maker.

	3.	If the matter is not remanded, the decision-maker to whom the matter has been transferred shall consider the application following the same procedures and subject to the same limitations as are applicable to the initial decision-maker, except that the body to which the matter has been transferred shall act within 45 days of the transfer of jurisdiction.&#xA0; The Department of City Planning, including the Office of Zoning Administration, shall make investigations and furnish any reports requested by the body to which the matter has been transferred.

	I.	Appeals.

	1.	Effective Date of Initial Decision.&#xA0; An initial decision becomes final and effective upon the close of the 15-day appeal period if not appealed, or as provided in this subsection if appealed.

	2.	Filing of an Appeal.&#xA0; An applicant or any other person aggrieved by the initial decision of the Zoning Administrator may appeal the decision to the Area Planning Commission.&#xA0; An applicant or any other person aggrieved by the initial decision of the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission may appeal the decision to the City Council.&#xA0; The appeal shall be filed within 15 days of the date of mailing of the initial decision on forms provided by the Department.&#xA0; The appeal shall set forth specifically the points at issue, the reasons for the appeal, and the basis upon which the appellant claims there was an error or abuse of discretion by the initial decision-maker.&#xA0; Any appeal not filed within the 15-day period shall not be considered by the appellate body.&#xA0; The filing of an appeal stays proceedings in the matter until the appellate body has made a decision.&#xA0; Once an appeal is filed, the initial decision-maker shall transmit the appeal and the file to the appellate body, together with any report if one was prepared by staff responding to the allegations made in the appeal.

	3.	Appellate Decision &#x2013; Public Hearing and Notice.&#xA0; Before acting on any appeal, the appellate body shall set the matter for hearing, giving the same notice as provided for the original hearing.&#xA0; When considering an appeal from the decision of an initial decision-maker, the appellate body shall make its decision, based on the record, as to whether the initial decision-maker erred or abused his or her discretion.

	4.	Time for Appellate Decision.&#xA0; The appellate body shall act within 75 days after the expiration of the appeal period or within any additional period mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the appellate body.&#xA0; The failure of the appellate body to adopt a resolution within this time period shall be deemed a denial of the appeal.

	5.	Appellate Decision.&#xA0; The appellate body may, by resolution, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, any decision of the initial decision-maker.&#xA0; If the City Council is the appellate body, the resolution to reverse or modify, in whole or in part, shall only be adopted by at least a two-thirds vote of the whole Council.&#xA0; For all appellate bodies, any resolution to approve must contain the same findings required to be made by the initial decision-maker, supported by facts in the record.

	6.	Procedures and Effective Date of Appellate Decision.

	(a)	When a conditional use decision is appealed to the City Council and the Council either approves the conditional use or denies an appeal from an earlier approval, the matter together with the files and reports shall forthwith be transmitted to the Mayor.&#xA0; The Mayor may approve or disapprove the conditional use within ten days of its presentation to him or her.&#xA0; This action shall be based solely upon the administrative record and whether the Mayor believes the conditional use conforms with the requirements for approval set forth in this section.&#xA0; If the Mayor disapproves the conditional use, he or she shall return the matter to the City Clerk for presentation to the Council, together with the objections in writing.&#xA0; The Council within 60 days after the matter has been returned to it may override the disapproval:

	(i)	by a two-thirds vote if the Council had not modified the conditional use as approved by the initial decision-maker, or if the Council had made the initial approval of the conditional use by reason of the failure of the initial decision-maker to act; or

	(ii)	by a three-fourths vote if the Council had modified and approved the conditional use or reversed the action of the initial decision-maker and had approved the conditional use.

	If the Council fails to override the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval within the 60 days, the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval shall constitute a denial of the conditional use.&#xA0; If the Mayor fails to return the matter to the City Clerk within ten days of its presentation to him or her, the approval of the conditional use shall become final.

	(b)	When a conditional use decision of the Zoning Administrator is appealed to an Area Planning Commission, the appellate decision of the Area Planning Commission shall be final and effective as provided in Charter Section 245.

	J.	(Deleted by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5/20/12.)

	K.	Limitation upon Approval of Planned Residential Developments.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the approval of any planned residential development as a conditional use shall not be complete or effective until the approval and the conditions imposed have been approved by ordinance.

	L.	Existing Uses.&#xA0; Any lot or portion of a lot which is being lawfully used for any of the purposes enumerated in this section at the time the property is first classified in a zone in which the use is permitted only by conditional use or at the time the use in that zone first becomes subject to the requirements of this section, shall be deemed to be approved for the conditional use and may be continued on the lot. Further, the conditions included in any special district ordinance, exception or variance which authorized the use shall also continue in effect.

	Any lot or portion of a lot in the C2, C3, C4, CM or M1 Zones which was being used on June 1, 1951, for the temporary storage of abandoned, dismantled, partially dismantled, obsolete or wrecked automobiles, but not for the dismantling or wrecking of automobiles nor for the storage or sale of used parts, may continue to be so used.

	Regulations governing yards, accessory buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks shall conform to the provisions of Title 25 of the California Administrative Code or any amendments.&#xA0; If yards, accessory buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks are not regulated by Title 25, they shall conform to all applicable provisions of this Code or any other conditions imposed by the City.

	Any CM uses lawfully existing prior to March 22, 1981, in any portion of any building in the C5 Zone shall not be extended beyond that portion of the building except as provided by Section 12.24W of this Code.

	M.	Development of Uses.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,992, Eff. 7/6/01.)

	1.	Development of Site.&#xA0; On any lot or portion of a lot on which a deemed- approved conditional use is permitted pursuant to the provisions of this section, new buildings or structures may be erected, enlargements may be made to existing buildings, and existing uses may be extended on an approved site, as permitted in Subsection L of this section, provided that plans are submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission, whichever has jurisdiction at the time. The Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission may deny the plans if the Zoning Administrator or the Commission finds that the use does not conform to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a conditional use under this section, and may specify the conditions under which the plans may be approved.

	The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission may delegate to the Director of Planning the authority to approve or disapprove, on their behalf, plans for the development of an approved or deemed-approved conditional use site.&#xA0; The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission shall establish reasonable guidelines and policies to be followed in the exercise of the delegated authority.

	EXCEPTIONS:

	A plan approval shall not be required in the following instances:

	(a)	For buildings within mobilehome parks located in the M2 Zone, which existed in that zone on September 3, 1961, provided that the entire approval site is retained for mobilehome park use and there is no increase in the number of mobilehome sites.

	(b)	For temporary structures erected on the site of a place of worship in an A Zone, if:

	(1)	the structures are erected and maintained not more than five days in any one year;

	(2)	all structures, including temporary facilities, are located at least 40 feet from all exterior lot lines;

	(3)	the required permits are obtained from the Fire Department, and all structures are removed from the premises the next day following the closing of the event;

	(4)	no public address system in connection with the event is installed on the property unless it is modulated so as not to be disturbing to occupants of nearby dwelling units; and

	(5)	any lights used to illuminate the area are arranged to reflect the light away from any adjacent residentially used premises.

	2.	Appeal.&#xA0; An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may appeal the decision to the Area Planning Commission pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.&#xA0; An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may appeal the decision to the City Council pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.

	N.	Reduction of Site. &#xA0; So long as the conditional use is continued, the entire approved site shall be retained for the conditional use, and no portion shall be severed from the site or utilized for other purposes unless the plans for the reduced site are first submitted to and approved by the initial decision-maker.

	The decision of an initial decision-maker on a proposed reduction of the area of an approved site shall be subject to the same appeal procedures as is provided for an application to establish the conditional use.

	O.	Findings and Conditions of Approval.&#xA0; In approving any conditional use plans, the initial decision-maker must find that the use conforms to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a conditional use under this section and may impose conditions on the same basis as provided for in this section for the establishment of new conditional uses.&#xA0; The initial decision-maker shall adopt written findings of fact supporting the decision based upon evidence in the record, including any investigations.

	P.	Change of Use.&#xA0; No conditional use may be changed to a different type of conditional use unless the new use is authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.

	Q.	Discontinuance of Use.&#xA0; If a conditional use is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not be re-established unless authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.

	R.	Planned Residential Developments or Housing Projects Approved as Conditional Uses.&#xA0; No provision of Section 13.04 of this Code shall be construed as limiting or modifying the provisions of any conditional use approval, or any other right already existing, for a housing project or planned residential development granted prior to the effective date of that section.&#xA0; The provisions of this section shall continue to apply to those developments, and the Commission is authorized to perform all required administrative acts.&#xA0; Provided, however, if a conditional use for a housing project or planned residential development approved prior to the effective date of Section 13.04 is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be re-established unless authorized as a Residential Planned Development Supplemental Use District.&#xA0; The planned residential development shall not be divided or separated in ownership unless authorized under supplemental use district procedures as a residential planned development.

	S.	As part of any conditional use approval, the initial decision-maker or the appellate body may approve changes to the parking requirements not to exceed 20% of the requirements otherwise required by the Code.

	T.	Vesting Conditional Use Applications.

	1.	Application.&#xA0; Whenever a provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code requires the filing of an application for a conditional use permit, a vesting conditional use permit may be filed instead, in accordance with these provisions.&#xA0; If an applicant does not seek the rights conferred by this subsection, the filing of a vesting application shall not be required by the City for the approval of any proposed zone change, conditional use permit, permit for construction or work preparatory to construction.

	2.	Development Rights.

	(b)	If the ordinances, policies, or standards described in the preceding paragraph are changed subsequent to the approval or conditional approval of a vesting application case, the applicant, or his or her successor or assignee, at any time prior to the expiration of the vesting application case, may apply, pursuant to Subdivision 4 of this subsection, for an amendment to the vesting application case to secure a vested right to proceed with the changed ordinances, policies, or standards.&#xA0; An application shall clearly specify the changed ordinances, policies, or standards for which the amendment is sought.

	(c)	Prior to final approval or signoff on a building permit filed pursuant to a vesting application, the Planning Department shall submit a copy of the final site plan to the office of the affected council district for informational purposes only.

	3.	Procedures.

	(a)	Filing and Processing an Application.&#xA0; A vesting conditional use permit application shall be filed on the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in Subsections B through Q for a conditional use permit except as provided below.&#xA0; The application shall specify that the case is for a vesting conditional use permit.&#xA0; If any rules, regulations or ordinances in force at the time of filing require any additional approvals (such as a variance or coastal development permit), the complete application for these additional approvals shall be filed prior to or simultaneously with the vesting conditional use permit to be processed pursuant to Section 12.36.&#xA0; In all vesting conditional use permit cases, a site plan and a rendering of the architectural plan of the building envelope shall be submitted with the application.&#xA0; The plans and renderings shall show the proposed project&#x2019;s height, design, size and square footage, number of units, the location of buildings, driveways, internal vehicular circulation patterns, loading areas and docks, location of landscaped areas, walls and fences, pedestrian and vehicular entrances, location of public rights-of-way and any other information deemed necessary by the Director of Planning.

	In making this finding, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the building&#x2019;s past and current vacancy rate, existing and previous uses, and real estate market information.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to submit independently verified documentation.

	(iii)	Buildings designated on the National Register of Historic Places, the California Register of Historical Resources, or the City of Los Angeles List of Historic-Cultural Monuments.&#xA0; Contributing Buildings in National Register Historic Districts or Contributing Structures in Historic Preservation Overlay Zones (HPOZ) established pursuant to Section 12.20.3 of this Code are also eligible buildings.

	(2)	Incentives and Exceptions.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator may grant, modify or deny some or all of the incentives set forth in Section 12.22&#xA0; A.26.(h), or some or all of the exceptions set forth in Section 12.22 A.26.(j), to Adaptive Reuse Projects proposed pursuant to this subdivision. Furthermore, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to grant any other incentives or exceptions from the Code required to permit Adaptive Reuse Projects proposed pursuant to this subdivision, including but not limited to the authority to permit dwelling units, guest rooms and joint living and work quarters in Adaptive Reuse Projects, notwithstanding the nonconforming provisions of Section 12.23 of the Code.

	Any application for a continuation of a nonconforming use of a building or structure must be filed with the Department of City Planning within 90 days following the service of an order to comply by the Department of Building and Safety upon an owner of a nonconforming use, or, in those instances where the Department is unable with reasonable effort to serve the owner, then within 90 days after the service by the Department of the order by leaving it with an occupant of the nonconforming use.&#xA0; If the application is not filed within 90 days, it shall not be considered pursuant to this subdivision.

	An application pursuant to this subdivision shall be set for public hearing and notice shall be given in the same manner as required in Section 12.24 of this Code unless the applicant has secured approval for the continuance of the nonconforming use from the owners of all properties abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner with the subject property.&#xA0; If approval is obtained from the surrounding property owners, the Zoning Administrator may waive the public hearing if he or she makes written findings that the nonconforming use will not have a significant adverse effect on adjoining property or on the immediate neighborhood, and that the nonconforming use is not likely to evoke public controversy.

	The Department of City Planning shall process these applications for continuation in accordance with Section 12.24 of this Code, except that the time limits prescribed for the making of a decision by a Zoning Administrator shall not apply.&#xA0; Appeals from a Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s decision approving or disapproving the continuation of a nonconforming use of a building or structure may be taken to the Area Planning Commission pursuant to Section 12.24 I. of this Code.&#xA0; No further appeal shall be permitted.

	Failure of the Area Planning Commission to act within 60 days of the filing of an appeal from the Zoning Administrator&#x2019;s decision approving or disapproving a continuation, or within any additional period as may be mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the Commission, shall be deemed to be a denial of the appeal.

	No fee shall be required for the initial application for a continuation.&#xA0; A fee shall be required for the second and subsequent requests for continuation pursuant to Section 19.01 F. of this Code.

	28.	Single-Family Zones in Hillside Area.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 181,624, Eff. 5/9/11.)&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may, upon application, grant the deviations outlined in Paragraph (a) of this Subdivision 28. on Lots in the R1, RS, RE, and RA Zones which are located in a Hillside Area as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code.

	(a)	Zoning Administrator Authority.&#xA0; If an owner seeks relief, a Zoning Administrator has the authority to grant the following deviations:

	(1)	Setback Requirements.&#xA0; A reduction of the Front and Side Yard setback requirements outlined in Paragraph (a) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code for Lots fronting on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street; however, in no event shall the Side Yard be less than 4 feet.

	(2)	Additions to Structures Existing Prior to August 1, 2010.&#xA0; Any additions made after August 1, 2010, to a One-Family Dwelling existing prior to that date for which permits have been previously obtained which exceed the requirements of Paragraph (b) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code, provided:

	(i)	the total cumulative Residential Floor Area of all such additions does not exceed 1,000 square feet; and

	(ii)	the resulting Building does not exceed the height of the original Building or the height permitted in Paragraph (d) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code, whichever is greater; and

	(iii)	at least two off-street covered parking spaces are provided.

	(3)	Height.&#xA0; Exceed the maximum envelope height requirements required by Paragraph (d) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code; however, the increase in height may not result in a Building or Structure which exceeds an overall height of 45 feet.&#xA0; The overall height shall be measured from the lowest Elevation point, within 5 horizontal feet of the exterior walls of a Building or Structure, to the highest elevation point of the roof Structure or parapet wall.

	(4)	Lot Coverage.&#xA0; Increase the maximum Lot coverage limitations as outlined in Paragraph (e) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code, up to a maximum of 50% of the Lot area.

	(i)	Grading in excess of the maximum &#x201C;by-right&#x201D; Grading quantities listed in Subparagraph (1) of Paragraph (f) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code, but in no event shall the quantities exceed the true value of 500 cubic yards plus the numeric value equal to 5% of the total Lot size in cubic yards.

	(ii)	For a property which fronts onto a Standard Hillside Limited Street of Larger, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, increase the maximum quantity of earth import or export greater than 500 cubic yards, and increase the maximum quantity of export greater than 1,000 cubic yards; calculated pursuant to Subparagraph (2) of Paragraph (f) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code.

	For a property which fronts onto a Substandard Hillside Limited Street, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, increase the maximum quantity of earth import greater than 375 cubic yards, and increase the maximum quantity of earth export greater than 750 cubic yards; calculated pursuant to Subparagraph (2) of Paragraph (f) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code.

	(6)	Off-Street Parking.&#xA0; Reduce the number of off-Street parking spaces required by Subparagraph (2) of Paragraph (g) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code.

	(i)	Adjacent Minimum Roadway Width. Do not meet the requirements of Subparagraph (2) of Paragraph (i) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code because they front on a Substandard Hillside Limited Street improved to a roadway width of less than 20 feet.

	(ii)	Minimum Roadway Width (Continuous Paved Roadway).&#xA0; Do not meet the requirements of Subparagraph (3) of Paragraph (i) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code because they do not have vehicular access from streets improved with a minimum 20-foot wide continuous paved roadway from the driveway apron that provides access to the main residence to the boundary of the Hillside Area.

	(b)	Findings.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator shall find that approval of any use in this Subsection is in conformity with the public necessity, convenience, general welfare and good zoning practice and that the action will be in substantial conformance with the various elements and objectives of the General Plan, and that the approval is consistent with the following applicable findings:

	(1)	Setback Requirements.&#xA0; That the reduction in yards will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the adjacent property or improvements.

	(2)	Additions to Structures Existing Prior to August 1, 2010.&#xA0; That the increase in Residential Floor Area will result in a Building or Structure which is compatible in scale with existing Structures in the vicinity; and that the approval is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the vicinity.

	(3)	Height.&#xA0; That the increase in height will result in a Building or Structure which is compatible in scale with existing Structures in the vicinity; and that the approval is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the vicinity.

	(4)	Lot Coverage.&#xA0; That the increase in Lot coverage will result in a development which is compatible in size and scale with other improvements in the immediate neighborhood; and that the increase will not result in a loss of privacy or access to light enjoyed by adjacent properties.

	(5)	Grading.

	(i)	That Grading in excess of the absolute maximum Grading quantities listed in Subparagraph (1) of Paragraph (f) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code is done in accordance with the Department of City Planning &#x2013; Planning Guidelines Landform Grading Manual (adopted by the City Council on June 1983), and is used to reflect original landform and result in minimum disturbance to natural terrain.&#xA0; Notching into hillsides is encouraged so that projects are built into natural terrain as much as possible.

	(ii)	That the increase in the maximum quantity of earth import or export will not lead to the significant alteration of the existing natural terrain, that the hauling of earth is being done in a manner that does not significantly affect the existing conditions of the Street improvements and traffic of the Streets along the haul route, and that potentially significant impacts to the public health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding community are being mitigated to the fullest extent feasible.

	(6)	Off-Street Parking.&#xA0; That the reduction of the parking requirements will not create an adverse impact on Street access or circulation in the surrounding neighborhood; and that the reduction will not be materially detrimental or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity in which the Lot is located.

	(7)	Street Access.

	(i)	That the vehicular traffic associated with the Building or Structure will not create an adverse impact on Street access or circulation in the surrounding neighborhood; and&#xA0;

	(ii)	That the Building or Structure will not be materially detrimental or injurious to the adjacent property or improvements; and

	(iii)	That the Building or Structure will not have a materially adverse safety impact on the surrounding neighborhood.

	(iv)	That the site and/or existing improvements make strict adherence to Paragraph (i) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21 of this Code impractical or infeasible.

	(c)	Procedures.&#xA0; An application pursuant to this Subdivision 28. shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 12.28 C.1., 2. and 3. of this Code.&#xA0; Except that public hearings for fences, walls, and retaining walls within required yards may not be required if the applicant submits with the application the written approval of the owners of all properties abutting, across the Street or alley from, or having a common corner with the subject property.

	(1)	Import/Export (Haul Route) Review.&#xA0; Upon filing an application pursuant to this Subdivision 28. for the import or export of earth materials pursuant to the authority granted in Subparagraph (5) of Paragraph (a) of this Subdivision, the Zoning Administrator shall request that the General Manager of the Department of Transportation investigate the circumstances of the proposed import or export of earth materials and the effect thereof upon the public health, safety, and welfare.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator shall request the City Engineer to determine the effect of any import or export on the structural integrity of the public Streets and to determine the effect on public safety relative to Street alignment, width, and Grade.

	In taking action on such Zoning Administrator Determination, the Zoning Administrator shall impose conditions of approval to mitigate any detrimental effects of the hauling operations necessary to import or export earth, including but not limited to: limiting truck weight, length and/or speed; and other conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure repair of damages to public Streets along the hauling route that may reasonably be expected to be caused by hauling operations.&#xA0; Such additional conditions may include a condition that the developer shall file a bond for the benefit of the City.&#xA0; Any such bond shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney, executed by the developer and a corporate surety authorized to do business in the State in an amount sufficient to cover the repair of any damage to the public Streets reasonably expected to be caused by the hauling operations.&#xA0; The conditions of the bond shall guarantee to indemnify the City for all costs and expense in repairing the damaged Streets or other public facilities.&#xA0; In lieu of a surety bond, the developer may file a cash bond with the Department upon the same terms and conditions and in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond.&#xA0; The deposit submitted may be in the form of cash or negotiable United States securities.&#xA0; The term of such effect until the completion of the hauling operations and subsequent inspection of the affected public Streets by the Department of Public Works.

	(d)	Conditions for Approval.&#xA0; In approving the uses and activities authorized in this Subdivision, the Zoning Administrator may impose those conditions he or she deems necessary to remedy a disparity of privileges and that are necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare and assure compliance with the objectives of the General Plan and the purpose and intent of the zoning.

	29.	Historical Vehicle Collection.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may allow the maintenance of a Historic Vehicle Collection as an accessory use.&#xA0; In addition to the findings set forth in Section 12.24 E., the Zoning Administrator shall find:

	(a)	that all the historic vehicles and parts maintained in outdoor storage, whether currently licensed or unlicensed, or whether operable or inoperable constitute an Historic Vehicle Collection;

	(b)	the Historic Vehicle Collection occupies less than 50 percent of the area of the lot for lots comprising 10,000 square feet or less, or 70 percent of the area of the lot for lots comprising more than 10,000 square feet.

	(c)	the Historic Vehicle Collection is fully screened from ordinary public view by means of a suitable fence, trees, shrubbery, opaque covering or other appropriate means;

	(d)	no portion of the Historic Vehicle Collection is located within five feet of any building or within any side yards required by this Code; and

	(e)	plans for the maintenance of the Historic Vehicle Collection have been submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the procedures in Section 12.28 C.1., 2. and 3. and subject to the same fees as in Section 19.01 E. for relief from fence height limitation.

	30.	Reduced Parking in a Modified Parking Requirement (MPR) District.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 182,242, Eff. 10/9/12.)&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may, upon application, reduce the number of off-street parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. of this Code, provided that the project is located within a Modified Parking Requirement (MPR) District established through the application of Section 13.15 of this Code, and provided further that the MPR District authorizes the Zoning Administrator to reduce the number of off-street parking spaces.

	Y.	Special Permission for Reduction of Off-Street Parking Spaces by the Director.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; A reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. may be permitted by the Director as the initial decision-maker or by the Area Planning Commission as the appellate body.&#xA0; The procedures for decisions on these uses shall be the same as those for variances as provided in Section 12.27 B. in addition to those set out below, except that the initial decision-maker shall be the Director, there is only one level of appeal and the findings necessary to grant the reduction shall be that the action is in conformity with the public necessity, convenience, general welfare and good zoning practice and that the action will be in substantial conformance with the various elements and objectives of the General Plan.

	If the Director finds that a commercial or industrial building is located on a lot not more than 1,500 feet distant from the portal of a fixed rail transit station, or bus station, or other similar transit facility, then the required number of parking spaces for that commercial or industrial building shall be decreased by ten percent of the number otherwise required by Section 12.21 A.4.(c).&#xA0; If the Director makes this finding, then no more than 90 percent of the parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4.(c) of this subdivision are required to be provided on the lot.&#xA0; The 1,500-foot distance shall be measured as specified in Section 12.21 A.4.(g).&#xA0; A portal shall be defined as the street-level entrance, exit or escalator of a transit station.

	A station may be used as the basis of a reduction if the Director decides that it is currently in use; that a full funding contract for a proposed station&#x2019;s location and portals have been signed by all funding partners; or that a resolution to fund a preferred alignment has been adopted by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission by a resolution detailing specific stations and portal locations.&#xA0; Before approving a parking reduction application filed pursuant to this subdivision, a Director shall find that the surrounding area will not be adversely affected by overflow parking or traffic congestion originating or terminating at the lot, and that the reduction will not otherwise be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the properties or improvements in the surrounding area.

	In the following cases, an application pursuant to this subsection shall be set for public hearing and notice shall be given pursuant to Section 12.27 C.:

	(i)	when it can reasonably be anticipated that approval of the application could have a significant adverse effect on adjoining properties or on the immediate neighborhood; or

	(ii)	when the application is likely to evoke public controversy.&#xA0; In all other cases an application pursuant to this subdivision need not be set for public hearing, unless the Director determines that a hearing would further the public interest.

	A copy of each application shall be promptly submitted to the Councilmember of the district in which the property is located.

	Z.	Revocation.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; If the conditions of any conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approvals granted pursuant to this section have not been complied with, the Director, or the City Planning Commission if the approval or conditional use was granted by the City Planning Commission, upon knowledge of the fact of non-compliance, may give notice to the record owner or lessee of the real property affected to appear at a time and place fixed by the City Planning Commission or Director and show cause why the decision granting the approval or conditional use should not be repealed or rescinded, as the case may be.&#xA0; The City Planning Commission may delegate its authority in this matter to the Director.&#xA0; After the hearing, the City Planning Commission or the Director may revoke the conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval.&#xA0; An appeal from this revocation action may be taken to the City Council in the same manner prescribed in Subsection I.&#xA0; The City Council&#x2019;s decision on appeal shall be reviewable as an approval of a conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval in the manner prescribed in Subsection I.6.

	After revocation, the property affected shall be subject to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as provided in this article.

	AA.	Additional Revocation Authority.&#xA0; The Director may require the modification, discontinuance, or revocation of any conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval granted in accordance with the procedure in this section in the manner prescribed in Section 12.27.1.&#xA0; In the event of a revocation, the property affected by the revocation shall be subject to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as provided in this article.</full_text><order_by>24</order_by><ancestry><unit id="20" label="article"><name>Specific Planning &#x2013; Zoning

CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS AND OTHER SIMILAR QUASI-JUDICIAL APPROVALS. (&#xA7; 12.24)

&#xA0; CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS AND OTHER SIMILAR QUASI-JUDICIAL APPROVALS.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 173,268, Eff. 7/1/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)	A.	Applicability.&#xA0;
(Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; This section shall apply to the
conditional use approvals listed in Subsections U, V and W and to the other
similar quasi-judicial approvals listed in Subsection X.&#xA0; These procedures
apply only to uses in zones when not permitted by right.	B.	Application for
Permit.&#xA0; To apply for a permit, an applicant shall file an application with the
Department of City Planning, on a form provided by the Department, and include
all information required by the instructions on the application and the
guidelines adopted by the Director of Planning.&#xA0; The Director of Planning shall
adopt guidelines which shall be used to determine when an application is deemed
complete.	C.	Initial Decision.&#xA0; Except as otherwise provided in Charter Section
564 and Section 12.36 of this Code, the initial decision on an application shall
be made by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission or the City
Planning Commission, as prescribed in Subsections U, V, W and X.	For purposes of
this section, the initial decision shall mean approval in whole or in part with
or without conditions, or denial of the application.	D.	Public Hearing and
Notice.&#xA0; Upon receipt of a complete application, the initial decision-maker
shall set the matter for public hearing at which evidence shall be taken and may
conduct the hearing itself or may designate a hearing officer to conduct the
hearing.	The Department shall give notice in all of the following
manners:	1.	Publication.&#xA0; By at least one publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City, designated for that purpose by the City Clerk, no less
than 24 days prior to the date of hearing; and	2.	Written Notice.	(a)	By mailing
a written notice no less than 24 days prior to the date of the hearing to the
applicant, the owner or owners of the property involved, and to the owners of
all property within and outside of the City that is within 500 feet of the
exterior boundaries of the property involved, using for the purpose of
notification, the last known name and address of owners as shown on the records
of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor.&#xA0; Where all property
within the 500-foot radius is under the same ownership as the property involved
in the application, the owners of all property that adjoins that ownership, or
is separated from it only by a street, alley, public right-of-way or other
easement, shall also be notified as set forth above; and&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No.
181,595, Eff. 4/10/11.)	(b)	By mailing a written notice no less than 24 days
prior to the date of the hearing to residential, commercial and industrial
occupants of all property within 500 feet of the exterior boundaries of the
property involved.&#xA0; This requirement can be met by mailing the notice to
&#x201C;occupant&#x201D;; and	(c)	If notice pursuant to Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will
not result in notice being given to at least 20 different owners of at least 20
different lots other than the subject property, then the 500-foot radius for
notification shall be increased in increments of 50 feet until the required
number of persons and lots are encompassed within the expanded area.&#xA0;
Notification shall then be given to all property owners and occupants within the
expanded area.	3.	Site Posting.&#xA0; By the applicant posting notice of the public
hearing in a conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior
to the date of the public hearing.&#xA0; If a hearing examiner is designated to
conduct the public hearing, then the applicant, in addition to posting notice of
the public hearing, shall also post notice of the initial meeting of the
decision-making body on the matter.&#xA0; This notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior to the date
of the meeting.&#xA0; The Director of Planning may adopt guidelines consistent with
this section for the posting of notices if the Director determines that those
guidelines are necessary and appropriate.	E.	Findings for Approval.&#xA0; (Amended
by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)&#xA0; A decision-maker shall not grant a
conditional use or other approval specified in Subsections U., V., W., or X. of
this Section without finding:	1.	that the project will enhance the built
environment in the surrounding neighborhood or will perform a function or
provide a service that is essential or beneficial to the community, city, or
region;	2.	that the project&#x2019;s location, size, height, operations and other
significant features will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or
further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public
health, welfare, and safety; and	3.	that the project substantially conforms with
the purpose, intent and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community
plan, and any applicable specific plan.	The decision-maker shall also make any
additional findings required by Subsections U., V., W. and X., and shall
determine that the project satisfies all applicable requirements in those
subsections.	F.	Conditions of Approval.&#xA0; In approving a project, the
decision-maker may impose conditions related to the interests addressed in the
findings set forth in Subsection E.&#xA0; The decision may state that the height and
area regulations required by other provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to
the conditional use approved.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff.
5/7/12.)	G.	Time to Act.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; The
initial decision shall be made within 75 days of the date the application is
deemed complete, or within an extended period as mutually agreed upon in writing
by the applicant and the decision-maker.&#xA0; An initial decision shall not be
considered made until written findings are adopted in accordance with Subsection
E. &#xA0; Upon making its decision, the initial decision-maker shall transmit a copy
of the written findings and decision to the applicant, to all owners of
properties abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner
with the subject property and to all persons who have filed a written request
for the notice with the Department of City Planning.	Notwithstanding any
provisions of this section to the contrary, the initial decision-maker shall
make its decision on any application for a hazardous waste storage, treatment,
or disposal facility, as governed by Subdivisions 10 and 11 of Subsection U of
this section, pursuant to the time limits as set forth in Article 8.7 of the
California Health and Safety Code.	H.	Failure to Act &#x2013; Transfer of
Jurisdiction.	1.	If the initial decision-maker fails to act on an application
within 75 days from the date of filing a complete application, or within a
mutually agreed upon extension of time, the applicant may file a request for a
transfer of jurisdiction to the designated appellate body for decision.&#xA0; The
designated appellate body is the body to whom the matter would normally be
appealable, pursuant to Subsections U, V, W and X.&#xA0; The Director of Planning
shall prescribe the form and manner of filing requests for transfers of
jurisdiction.	2.	When the designated appellate body receives the applicant&#x2019;s
request for a transfer of jurisdiction, the initial decision-maker shall lose
jurisdiction.&#xA0; However, the body to whom the matter is transferred may remand
the matter to the initial decision-maker who shall regain jurisdiction for the
time and purpose specified in the remand action.&#xA0; In addition, upon receipt of
a written request by the applicant for withdrawal of the transfer of
jurisdiction prior to the matter being heard by the appellate body, the matter
shall be remanded to the initial decision-maker.	3.	If the matter is not
remanded, the decision-maker to whom the matter has been transferred shall
consider the application following the same procedures and subject to the same
limitations as are applicable to the initial decision-maker, except that the
body to which the matter has been transferred shall act within 45 days of the
transfer of jurisdiction.&#xA0; The Department of City Planning, including the
Office of Zoning Administration, shall make investigations and furnish any
reports requested by the body to which the matter has been
transferred.	I.	Appeals.	1.	Effective Date of Initial Decision.&#xA0; An initial
decision becomes final and effective upon the close of the 15-day appeal period
if not appealed, or as provided in this subsection if appealed.	2.	Filing of an
Appeal.&#xA0; An applicant or any other person aggrieved by the initial decision of
the Zoning Administrator may appeal the decision to the Area Planning
Commission.&#xA0; An applicant or any other person aggrieved by the initial decision
of the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission may appeal the
decision to the City Council.&#xA0; The appeal shall be filed within 15 days of the
date of mailing of the initial decision on forms provided by the Department.&#xA0;
The appeal shall set forth specifically the points at issue, the reasons for the
appeal, and the basis upon which the appellant claims there was an error or
abuse of discretion by the initial decision-maker.&#xA0; Any appeal not filed within
the 15-day period shall not be considered by the appellate body.&#xA0; The filing of
an appeal stays proceedings in the matter until the appellate body has made a
decision.&#xA0; Once an appeal is filed, the initial decision-maker shall transmit
the appeal and the file to the appellate body, together with any report if one
was prepared by staff responding to the allegations made in the
appeal.	3.	Appellate Decision &#x2013; Public Hearing and Notice.&#xA0; Before acting on
any appeal, the appellate body shall set the matter for hearing, giving the same
notice as provided for the original hearing.&#xA0; When considering an appeal from
the decision of an initial decision-maker, the appellate body shall make its
decision, based on the record, as to whether the initial decision-maker erred or
abused his or her discretion.	4.	Time for Appellate Decision.&#xA0; The appellate
body shall act within 75 days after the expiration of the appeal period or
within any additional period mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the
appellate body.&#xA0; The failure of the appellate body to adopt a resolution within
this time period shall be deemed a denial of the appeal.	5.	Appellate
Decision.&#xA0; The appellate body may, by resolution, reverse or modify, in whole
or in part, any decision of the initial decision-maker.&#xA0; If the City Council is
the appellate body, the resolution to reverse or modify, in whole or in part,
shall only be adopted by at least a two-thirds vote of the whole Council.&#xA0; For
all appellate bodies, any resolution to approve must contain the same findings
required to be made by the initial decision-maker, supported by facts in the
record.	6.	Procedures and Effective Date of Appellate Decision.	(a)	When a
conditional use decision is appealed to the City Council and the Council either
approves the conditional use or denies an appeal from an earlier approval, the
matter together with the files and reports shall forthwith be transmitted to the
Mayor.&#xA0; The Mayor may approve or disapprove the conditional use within ten days
of its presentation to him or her.&#xA0; This action shall be based solely upon the
administrative record and whether the Mayor believes the conditional use
conforms with the requirements for approval set forth in this section.&#xA0; If the
Mayor disapproves the conditional use, he or she shall return the matter to the
City Clerk for presentation to the Council, together with the objections in
writing.&#xA0; The Council within 60 days after the matter has been returned to it
may override the disapproval:	(i)	by a two-thirds vote if the Council had not
modified the conditional use as approved by the initial decision-maker, or if
the Council had made the initial approval of the conditional use by reason of
the failure of the initial decision-maker to act; or	(ii)	by a three-fourths
vote if the Council had modified and approved the conditional use or reversed
the action of the initial decision-maker and had approved the conditional
use.	If the Council fails to override the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval within the 60
days, the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval shall constitute a denial of the conditional
use.&#xA0; If the Mayor fails to return the matter to the City Clerk within ten days
of its presentation to him or her, the approval of the conditional use shall
become final.	(b)	When a conditional use decision of the Zoning Administrator is
appealed to an Area Planning Commission, the appellate decision of the Area
Planning Commission shall be final and effective as provided in Charter Section
245.	J.	(Deleted by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5/20/12.)	K.	Limitation upon Approval
of Planned Residential Developments.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision of
this section, the approval of any planned residential development as a
conditional use shall not be complete or effective until the approval and the
conditions imposed have been approved by ordinance.	L.	Existing Uses.&#xA0; Any lot
or portion of a lot which is being lawfully used for any of the purposes
enumerated in this section at the time the property is first classified in a
zone in which the use is permitted only by conditional use or at the time the
use in that zone first becomes subject to the requirements of this section,
shall be deemed to be approved for the conditional use and may be continued on
the lot. Further, the conditions included in any special district ordinance,
exception or variance which authorized the use shall also continue in
effect.	Any lot or portion of a lot in the C2, C3, C4, CM or M1 Zones which was
being used on June 1, 1951, for the temporary storage of abandoned, dismantled,
partially dismantled, obsolete or wrecked automobiles, but not for the
dismantling or wrecking of automobiles nor for the storage or sale of used
parts, may continue to be so used.	Regulations governing yards, accessory
buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks
shall conform to the provisions of Title 25 of the California Administrative
Code or any amendments.&#xA0; If yards, accessory buildings, parking, access, or any
other internal features of mobilehome parks are not regulated by Title 25, they
shall conform to all applicable provisions of this Code or any other conditions
imposed by the City.	Any CM uses lawfully existing prior to March 22, 1981, in
any portion of any building in the C5 Zone shall not be extended beyond that
portion of the building except as provided by Section 12.24W of this
Code.	M.	Development of Uses.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,992, Eff.
7/6/01.)	1.	Development of Site.&#xA0; On any lot or portion of a lot on which a
deemed- approved conditional use is permitted pursuant to the provisions of this
section, new buildings or structures may be erected, enlargements may be made to
existing buildings, and existing uses may be extended on an approved site, as
permitted in Subsection L of this section, provided that plans are submitted to
and approved by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the
City Planning Commission, whichever has jurisdiction at the time. The Zoning
Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission may
deny the plans if the Zoning Administrator or the Commission finds that the use
does not conform to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a
conditional use under this section, and may specify the conditions under which
the plans may be approved.	The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning
Commission may delegate to the Director of Planning the authority to approve or
disapprove, on their behalf, plans for the development of an approved or
deemed-approved conditional use site.&#xA0; The Area Planning Commission and the
City Planning Commission shall establish reasonable guidelines and policies to
be followed in the exercise of the delegated authority.	EXCEPTIONS:	A plan
approval shall not be required in the following instances:	(a)	For buildings
within mobilehome parks located in the M2 Zone, which existed in that zone on
September 3, 1961, provided that the entire approval site is retained for
mobilehome park use and there is no increase in the number of mobilehome
sites.	(b)	For temporary structures erected on the site of a place of worship in
an A Zone, if:	(1)	the structures are erected and maintained not more than five
days in any one year;	(2)	all structures, including temporary facilities, are
located at least 40 feet from all exterior lot lines;	(3)	the required permits
are obtained from the Fire Department, and all structures are removed from the
premises the next day following the closing of the event;	(4)	no public address
system in connection with the event is installed on the property unless it is
modulated so as not to be disturbing to occupants of nearby dwelling units;
and	(5)	any lights used to illuminate the area are arranged to reflect the light
away from any adjacent residentially used premises.	2.	Appeal.&#xA0; An applicant
submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of
the Zoning Administrator made relative to the approval or disapproval of a
development plan may appeal the decision to the Area Planning Commission
pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.&#xA0; An applicant submitting
development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Area
Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission made relative to the
approval or disapproval of a development plan may appeal the decision to the
City Council pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.	N.	Reduction of Site.
&#xA0; So long as the conditional use is continued, the entire approved site shall
be retained for the conditional use, and no portion shall be severed from the
site or utilized for other purposes unless the plans for the reduced site are
first submitted to and approved by the initial decision-maker.	The decision of
an initial decision-maker on a proposed reduction of the area of an approved
site shall be subject to the same appeal procedures as is provided for an
application to establish the conditional use.	O.	Findings and Conditions of
Approval.&#xA0; In approving any conditional use plans, the initial decision-maker
must find that the use conforms to the purpose and intent of the findings
required for a conditional use under this section and may impose conditions on
the same basis as provided for in this section for the establishment of new
conditional uses.&#xA0; The initial decision-maker shall adopt written findings of
fact supporting the decision based upon evidence in the record, including any
investigations.	P.	Change of Use.&#xA0; No conditional use may be changed to a
different type of conditional use unless the new use is authorized in accordance
with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a
conditional use.	Q.	Discontinuance of Use.&#xA0; If a conditional use is abandoned,
or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not be
re-established unless authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in
this section for the establishment of a conditional use.	R.	Planned Residential
Developments or Housing Projects Approved as Conditional Uses.&#xA0; No provision of
Section 13.04 of this Code shall be construed as limiting or modifying the
provisions of any conditional use approval, or any other right already existing,
for a housing project or planned residential development granted prior to the
effective date of that section.&#xA0; The provisions of this section shall continue
to apply to those developments, and the Commission is authorized to perform all
required administrative acts.&#xA0; Provided, however, if a conditional use for a
housing project or planned residential development approved prior to the
effective date of Section 13.04 is abandoned, or is discontinued for a
continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be re-established unless
authorized as a Residential Planned Development Supplemental Use District.&#xA0; The
planned residential development shall not be divided or separated in ownership
unless authorized under supplemental use district procedures as a residential
planned development.	S.	As part of any conditional use approval, the initial
decision-maker or the appellate body may approve changes to the parking
requirements not to exceed 20% of the requirements otherwise required by the
Code.	T.	Vesting Conditional Use Applications.	1.	Application.&#xA0; Whenever a
provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code requires the filing of an
application for a conditional use permit, a vesting conditional use permit may
be filed instead, in accordance with these provisions.&#xA0; If an applicant does
not seek the rights conferred by this subsection, the filing of a vesting
application shall not be required by the City for the approval of any proposed
zone change, conditional use permit, permit for construction or work preparatory
to construction.	2.	Development Rights.	(a)	The approval of a vesting
application shall confer a vested right to proceed with a development in
substantial compliance with the rules, regulations, ordinances, zones and
officially adopted policies of the City of Los Angeles in force on the date the
application is deemed complete, and with the conditions of approval imposed and
specifically enumerated by the decision maker in its action on the vesting
application case.&#xA0; These rights shall not include exemption from other
applications or approvals that may be necessary to entitle a project to proceed
(i.e., subdivision, parcel map, zone variance, design review, etc.) and from
subsequent changes in the Building and Safety and Fire regulations contained in
Chapters V and IX of the Los Angeles Municipal Code found necessary by the City
Council to protect the public health and safety and which are applicable on a
citywide basis and policies and standards relating to those regulations or from
citywide programs enacted after the application is deemed complete to implement
State or Federal mandates.	(b)	If the ordinances, policies, or standards
described in the preceding paragraph are changed subsequent to the approval or
conditional approval of a vesting application case, the applicant, or his or her
successor or assignee, at any time prior to the expiration of the vesting
application case, may apply, pursuant to Subdivision 4 of this subsection, for
an amendment to the vesting application case to secure a vested right to proceed
with the changed ordinances, policies, or standards.&#xA0; An application shall
clearly specify the changed ordinances, policies, or standards for which the
amendment is sought.	(c)	Prior to final approval or signoff on a building permit
filed pursuant to a vesting application, the Planning Department shall submit a
copy of the final site plan to the office of the affected council district for
informational purposes only.	3.	Procedures.	(a)	Filing and Processing an
Application.&#xA0; A vesting conditional use permit application shall be filed on
the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and
shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in Subsections B through Q
for a conditional use permit except as provided below.&#xA0; The application shall
specify that the case is for a vesting conditional use permit.&#xA0; If any rules,
regulations or ordinances in force at the time of filing require any additional
approvals (such as a variance or coastal development permit), the complete
application for these additional approvals shall be filed prior to or
simultaneously with the vesting conditional use permit to be processed pursuant
to Section 12.36.&#xA0; In all vesting conditional use permit cases, a site plan and
a rendering of the architectural plan of the building envelope shall be
submitted with the application.&#xA0; The plans and renderings shall show the
proposed project&#x2019;s height, design, size and square footage, number of units,
the location of buildings, driveways, internal vehicular circulation patterns,
loading areas and docks, location of landscaped areas, walls and fences,
pedestrian and vehicular entrances, location of public rights-of-way and any

Paragraph (b) of this Subdivision, prior to approval of a Superstore that is
located in an Economic Assistance Area, the City Planning Commission or the City
Council on appeal shall find, after consideration of all economic benefits and
costs, that the Superstore would not materially adversely affect the economic
welfare of the Impact Area, based upon information contained in an economic
impact analysis report submitted by the applicant, any other information
received or obtained by the Community Development Department or the Community
Redevelopment Agency, a recommendation by the Community Development Department,
or the Community Redevelopment Agency pursuant to Subparagraph (3) below, and
any other information received before or at a public hearing required by this
Section.&#xA0; The phrase &#x201C;Impact Area&#x201D; refers to a three mile radius

conjunction with its application to the Department of Planning.&#xA0; The economic
impact analysis report shall be reviewed by the Department or Agency and/or a
consultant, if deemed necessary by the Department or Agency and paid for in full
by the applicant.&#xA0; The Community Development Department and the Community
Redevelopment Agency shall complete its review of the report within 60 days
after receipt of the report from the applicant.&#xA0; The report shall identify
whether:	(i)	Efforts to establish a market larger than 20,000 square feet within
the Impact Area have been unsuccessful or whether the proposed use will have an
adverse impact or economic benefit on grocery or retail shopping centers in the
Impact Area;	(ii)	The Superstore would result in the physical displacement of
any businesses, and, if so, the nature of the displaced businesses or would
create economic stimulation in the Impact Area;	(iii)	The Superstore would
require the demolition of housing, or any other action or change that results in
a decrease of extremely low, very low, low or moderate income housing on
site;	(iv)	The Superstore would result in the destruction or demolition of any
park or other green space, playground, childcare facility, community
center;	(v)	The Superstore would provide lower in cost and/or higher in quality
goods and services to residents than currently available or that are currently
unavailable from a cost benefit perspective within the Impact Area in which the
project is proposed to be located;	(vi)	The Superstore would displace jobs
within the Impact Area or provide economic revitalization and/or job creation.&#xA0;
For purposes of determining this impact, the applicant must identify the number
of jobs displaced or created, the quality of the jobs, whether the jobs are
temporary or permanent, and the employment sector in which the lost jobs are
located;	(vii)	The Superstore would have a fiscal impact either positive or
negative on City tax revenue;	(viii)	Any restrictions exist on the subsequent
use of the property on which the Superstore is proposed to be located, including
the provisions of a lease if applicable, which, in the event the owner or
operator of the Superstore vacates the premises, would require the premises to
remain vacant for a significant amount of time;	(ix)	The Superstore will result
in any materially adverse or positive economic impacts or blight on the Impact

located across the street from any portion of each other.	Individual buildings
may fall below the minimum average unit size standard, so long as the average
size of all the dwelling units and joint living and work quarters in the unified
Adaptive Reuse Project is at least 750 square feet, and no dwelling unit or
joint living and work quarters is less than 450 square feet in area.&#xA0; The
Zoning Administrator shall determine whether a Project meets the definition of a
unified Adaptive Reuse Project as set forth above.&#xA0; All owners of the property
requesting floor area averaging must sign the application.&#xA0; A current title
search shall be submitted with the application to insure that all required
persons have signed the application.	If the Zoning Administrator approves the
floor area averaging, then all owners of the property requesting floor area
averaging and all owners of each lot contained in the unified Adaptive Reuse
Project shall execute and record an affidavit.&#xA0; A copy of each executed and
recorded affidavit shall be filed with the Office of Zoning Administration.&#xA0;
Each affidavit shall run with the land, be approved by the Zoning Administrator
prior to the issuance of any building permits, and shall guarantee the
following: (1) The use of any floor area converted to dwelling units or joint
living and work quarters shall be maintained and not changed; and (2) The number
of these units or quarters approved by the Zoning Administrator shall not be
increased.	(e)	Procedures.&#xA0; An application for permission pursuant to this
subdivision shall follow the procedures for adjustments set forth in Section
12.28 C.1., 2., and 3.&#xA0; However, the Zoning Administrator may waive the public

have expressed in writing no objections to the Adaptive Reuse
Project.	2.	Alcoholic Beverages.&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may, upon application,
permit a restaurant, with seating on the premises for no more than 50 persons,

application for permission pursuant to this subdivision shall follow the
procedures for variances set forth in Section 12.27 C. except to the extent an
additional appeal is permitted to City Council.&#xA0; If, however, the applicant
submits with its application the written approval of owners of all properties
abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner with the
subject corner, then the matter does not have to be set for public
hearing.	(b)	Findings.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)&#xA0; In
addition to the findings set forth in Section 12.24 E., the Zoning Administrator

adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood.	(c)	Conditions.&#xA0; The Zoning
Administrator may impose any conditions necessary to assure that the premises
continue to operate in a manner consistent with the findings.&#xA0; In addition, any
application approved pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject to the
following conditions and restrictions:	(1)	Alcoholic beverages, including beer
and wine, may be sold or dispensed for consideration for consumption on the
premises only, and only when served at tables or sit-down counters by employees
of the restaurant.	EXCEPTION:	However, beer and wine may be sold or dispensed
for consideration for consumption beyond the premises in a delicatessen (which
is a restaurant having regular take-out service of prepared and unprepared
foods), if and only if the sit-down food and beverage service area of the
delicatessen occupies in excess of 50 percent of the floor area of the premises
(exclusive of the kitchen, restroom, storage and utility areas);	(2)	Dancing or
live entertainment shall not be permitted on the premises;	(3)	A separate
cocktail lounge or bar shall not be located on the premises;	(4)	Alcoholic
beverages or beer or wine shall not be served in conjunction with the operation
of any billiard or pool hall, bowling alley, or adult entertainment business as

properties abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner
with the subject property.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,992, Eff.
7/6/01.)	(c)	Findings.&#xA0; In addition to the findings otherwise required by this
section, the Zoning Administrator shall also consider the uses to which the
proposed antenna will be put, and may give special consideration to an
application involving public service uses, such as participation in a radio
amateur emergency network or	4.	(Repealed by Ord. No. 178,382, Eff.

a habitable room closer than 35 feet from a legally established equine use, if
the Zoning Administrator determines that the residential building cannot
reasonably be constructed at a location 35 feet or greater from a legally

the private property contiguous to the property involved in the application sign
a waiver of having a public hearing, then no notice or hearing shall be
required.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff. 4/10/11.)	6.	Farmer&#x2019;s

to this subdivision:	(1)	The commercial use and/or reduced parking is compatible
with, and will not adversely impact property within, the surrounding area or

12.21 of this Code is done in accordance with the Department of City Planning
&#x2013; Planning Guidelines Landform Grading Manual (adopted by the City Council on
June 1983), and is used to reflect original landform and result in minimum
disturbance to natural terrain.&#xA0; Notching into hillsides is encouraged so that
projects are built into natural terrain as much as possible.	(ii)	That the
increase in the maximum quantity of earth import or export will not lead to the
significant alteration of the existing natural terrain, that the hauling of
earth is being done in a manner that does not significantly affect the existing
conditions of the Street improvements and traffic of the Streets along the haul
route, and that potentially significant impacts to the public health, safety,
and welfare of the surrounding community are being mitigated to the fullest
extent feasible.	(6)	Off-Street Parking.&#xA0; That the reduction of the parking
requirements will not create an adverse impact on Street access or circulation
in the surrounding neighborhood; and that the reduction will not be materially
detrimental or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity in
which the Lot is located.	(7)	Street Access.	(i)	That the vehicular traffic
associated with the Building or Structure will not create an adverse impact on
Street access or circulation in the surrounding neighborhood; and&#xA0;	(ii)	That
the Building or Structure will not be materially detrimental or injurious to the
adjacent property or improvements; and	(iii)	That the Building or Structure will
not have a materially adverse safety impact on the surrounding
neighborhood.	(iv)	That the site and/or existing improvements make strict
adherence to Paragraph (i) of Subdivision 10. of Subsection C. of Section 12.21
of this Code impractical or infeasible.	(c)	Procedures.&#xA0; An application
pursuant to this Subdivision 28. shall follow the procedures set forth in
Section 12.28 C.1., 2. and 3. of this Code.&#xA0; Except that public hearings for
fences, walls, and retaining walls within required yards may not be required if
the applicant submits with the application the written approval of the owners of
all properties abutting, across the Street or alley from, or having a common
corner with the subject property.	(1)	Import/Export (Haul Route) Review.&#xA0; Upon
filing an application pursuant to this Subdivision 28. for the import or export
of earth materials pursuant to the authority granted in Subparagraph (5) of
Paragraph (a) of this Subdivision, the Zoning Administrator shall request that
the General Manager of the Department of Transportation investigate the
circumstances of the proposed import or export of earth materials and the effect
thereof upon the public health, safety, and welfare.&#xA0; The Zoning Administrator
shall request the City Engineer to determine the effect of any import or export
on the structural integrity of the public Streets and to determine the effect on
public safety relative to Street alignment, width, and Grade.	In taking action
on such Zoning Administrator Determination, the Zoning Administrator shall
impose conditions of approval to mitigate any detrimental effects of the hauling
operations necessary to import or export earth, including but not limited to:
limiting truck weight, length and/or speed; and other conditions of approval as
may be necessary to ensure repair of damages to public Streets along the hauling
route that may reasonably be expected to be caused by hauling operations.&#xA0; Such
additional conditions may include a condition that the developer shall file a
bond for the benefit of the City.&#xA0; Any such bond shall be in a form approved by
the City Attorney, executed by the developer and a corporate surety authorized
to do business in the State in an amount sufficient to cover the repair of any
damage to the public Streets reasonably expected to be caused by the hauling
operations.&#xA0; The conditions of the bond shall guarantee to indemnify the City
for all costs and expense in repairing the damaged Streets or other public
facilities.&#xA0; In lieu of a surety bond, the developer may file a cash bond with
the Department upon the same terms and conditions and in an amount equal to that
which would be required in the surety bond.&#xA0; The deposit submitted may be in
the form of cash or negotiable United States securities.&#xA0; The term of such
effect until the completion of the hauling operations and subsequent inspection
of the affected public Streets by the Department of Public Works.	(d)	Conditions
for Approval.&#xA0; In approving the uses and activities authorized in this
Subdivision, the Zoning Administrator may impose those conditions he or she
deems necessary to remedy a disparity of privileges and that are necessary to
protect the public health, safety or welfare and assure compliance with the
objectives of the General Plan and the purpose and intent of the
zoning.	29.	Historical Vehicle Collection.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff.
5/7/12.)&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may allow the maintenance of a Historic
Vehicle Collection as an accessory use.&#xA0; In addition to the findings set forth
in Section 12.24 E., the Zoning Administrator shall find:	(a)	that all the
historic vehicles and parts maintained in outdoor storage, whether currently
licensed or unlicensed, or whether operable or inoperable constitute an Historic
Vehicle Collection;	(b)	the Historic Vehicle Collection occupies less than 50
percent of the area of the lot for lots comprising 10,000 square feet or less,
or 70 percent of the area of the lot for lots comprising more than 10,000 square
feet.	(c)	the Historic Vehicle Collection is fully screened from ordinary public
view by means of a suitable fence, trees, shrubbery, opaque covering or other
appropriate means;	(d)	no portion of the Historic Vehicle Collection is located
within five feet of any building or within any side yards required by this Code;
and	(e)	plans for the maintenance of the Historic Vehicle Collection have been
submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the
procedures in Section 12.28 C.1., 2. and 3. and subject to the same fees as in
Section 19.01 E. for relief from fence height limitation.	30.	Reduced Parking in
a Modified Parking Requirement (MPR) District.&#xA0; (Added by Ord. No. 182,242,
Eff. 10/9/12.)&#xA0; A Zoning Administrator may, upon application, reduce the number
of off-street parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. of this Code,
provided that the project is located within a Modified Parking Requirement (MPR)
District established through the application of Section 13.15 of this Code, and
provided further that the MPR District authorizes the Zoning Administrator to
reduce the number of off-street parking spaces.	Y.	Special Permission for
Reduction of Off-Street Parking Spaces by the Director.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No.
173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; A reduction in the number of off-street parking
spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. may be permitted by the Director as the
initial decision-maker or by the Area Planning Commission as the appellate
body.&#xA0; The procedures for decisions on these uses shall be the same as those
for variances as provided in Section 12.27 B. in addition to those set out
below, except that the initial decision-maker shall be the Director, there is
only one level of appeal and the findings necessary to grant the reduction shall
be that the action is in conformity with the public necessity, convenience,
general welfare and good zoning practice and that the action will be in
substantial conformance with the various elements and objectives of the General
Plan.	If the Director finds that a commercial or industrial building is located
on a lot not more than 1,500 feet distant from the portal of a fixed rail
transit station, or bus station, or other similar transit facility, then the
required number of parking spaces for that commercial or industrial building
shall be decreased by ten percent of the number otherwise required by Section
12.21 A.4.(c).&#xA0; If the Director makes this finding, then no more than 90
percent of the parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4.(c) of this
subdivision are required to be provided on the lot.&#xA0; The 1,500-foot distance
shall be measured as specified in Section 12.21 A.4.(g).&#xA0; A portal shall be
defined as the street-level entrance, exit or escalator of a transit station.	A
station may be used as the basis of a reduction if the Director decides that it
is currently in use; that a full funding contract for a proposed station&#x2019;s
location and portals have been signed by all funding partners; or that a
resolution to fund a preferred alignment has been adopted by the Los Angeles
County Transportation Commission by a resolution detailing specific stations and
portal locations.&#xA0; Before approving a parking reduction application filed
pursuant to this subdivision, a Director shall find that the surrounding area
will not be adversely affected by overflow parking or traffic congestion
originating or terminating at the lot, and that the reduction will not otherwise
be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the properties
or improvements in the surrounding area.	In the following cases, an application
pursuant to this subsection shall be set for public hearing and notice shall be
given pursuant to Section 12.27 C.:	(i)	when it can reasonably be anticipated
that approval of the application could have a significant adverse effect on
adjoining properties or on the immediate neighborhood; or	(ii)	when the
application is likely to evoke public controversy.&#xA0; In all other cases an
application pursuant to this subdivision need not be set for public hearing,
unless the Director determines that a hearing would further the public
interest.	A copy of each application shall be promptly submitted to the
Councilmember of the district in which the property is located.	Z.	Revocation.&#xA0;
(Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; If the conditions of any
conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approvals granted pursuant to
this section have not been complied with, the Director, or the City Planning
Commission if the approval or conditional use was granted by the City Planning
Commission, upon knowledge of the fact of non-compliance, may give notice to the
record owner or lessee of the real property affected to appear at a time and
place fixed by the City Planning Commission or Director and show cause why the
decision granting the approval or conditional use should not be repealed or
rescinded, as the case may be.&#xA0; The City Planning Commission may delegate its
authority in this matter to the Director.&#xA0; After the hearing, the City Planning
Commission or the Director may revoke the conditional use or other similar
quasi-judicial approval.&#xA0; An appeal from this revocation action may be taken to
the City Council in the same manner prescribed in Subsection I.&#xA0; The City
Council&#x2019;s decision on appeal shall be reviewable as an approval of a
conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval in the manner
prescribed in Subsection I.6.	After revocation, the property affected shall be
subject to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as
provided in this article.	AA.	Additional Revocation Authority.&#xA0; The Director
may require the modification, discontinuance, or revocation of any conditional
use or other similar quasi-judicial approval granted in accordance with the
procedure in this section in the manner prescribed in Section 12.27.1.&#xA0; In the
event of a revocation, the property affected by the revocation shall be subject
to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as provided
in this article.

No. 181,595, Eff. 4/10/11.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(b)	By mailing a written notice no less than 24 days prior to the date of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; to residential, commercial and industrial occupants of all property within 500 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved.&#xA0; This requirement can be met by mailing the notice to &#x201C;occupant&#x201D;; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(c)	If notice pursuant to Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will not result in notice being given to at least 20 different owners of at least 20 different lots other than the subject property, then the 500-foot radius for notification shall be increased in increments of 50 feet until the required number of persons and lots are encompassed within the expanded area.&#xA0; Notification shall then be given to all property owners and occupants within the expanded area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	Site Posting.&#xA0; By the applicant posting notice of the public &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; in a conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior to the date of the public &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; If a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; examiner is designated to conduct the public &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt;, then the applicant, in addition to posting notice of the public &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt;, shall also post notice of the initial meeting of the decision-making body on the matter.&#xA0; This notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior to the date of the meeting.&#xA0; The Director of Planning may adopt guidelines consistent with this section for the posting of notices if the Director determines that those guidelines are necessary and appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	E.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Findings&lt;/span&gt; for Approval.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)&#xA0; A decision-maker shall not grant a conditional use or other approval specified in Subsections U., V., W., or X. of this Section without &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;finding&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.	that the project will enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood or will perform a function or provide a service that is essential or beneficial to the community, city, or region;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	that the project&#x2019;s location, size, height, operations and other significant features will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare, and safety; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	that the project substantially conforms with the purpose, &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt; and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan, and any applicable specific plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	The decision-maker shall also make any additional &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; required by Subsections U., V., W. and X., and shall determine that the project satisfies all applicable requirements in those subsections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	F.

No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	G.	Time to Act.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; The initial decision shall be made within 75 days of the date the application is deemed complete, or within an extended period as mutually agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the decision-maker.&#xA0; An initial decision shall not be considered made until written &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; are adopted in accordance with Subsection E. &#xA0; Upon making its decision, the initial decision-maker shall transmit a copy of the written &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; and decision to the applicant, to all owners of properties abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner with the subject property and to all persons who have filed a written request for the notice with the Department of City Planning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, the initial decision-maker shall make its decision on any application for a hazardous waste storage, treatment, or disposal facility, as governed by Subdivisions 10 and 11 of Subsection U of this section, pursuant to the time limits as set forth in Article 8.7 of the California Health and Safety Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	H.

When the designated &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body receives the applicant&#x2019;s request for a transfer of &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt;, the initial decision-maker shall lose &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; However, the body to whom the matter is transferred may &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;remand&lt;/span&gt; the matter to the initial decision-maker who shall regain &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt; for the time and purpose specified in the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;remand&lt;/span&gt; action.&#xA0; In addition, upon receipt of a written request by the applicant for withdrawal of the transfer of &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt; prior to the matter being heard by the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body, the matter shall be remanded to the initial decision-maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	3.	If the matter is not remanded, the decision-maker to whom the matter has been transferred shall consider the application following the same procedures and subject to the same limitations as are applicable to the initial decision-maker, except that the body to which the matter has been transferred shall act within 45 days of the transfer of &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; The Department of City Planning, including the Office of Zoning Administration, shall make investigations and furnish any reports requested by the body to which the matter has been transferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	I.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Appeals&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.

Time for &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Appellate&lt;/span&gt; Decision.&#xA0; The &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body shall act within 75 days after the expiration of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; period or within any additional period mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body.&#xA0; The failure of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body to adopt a resolution within this time period shall be deemed a denial of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	5.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Appellate&lt;/span&gt; Decision.&#xA0; The &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body may, by resolution, &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt; or modify, in whole or in part, any decision of the initial decision-maker.&#xA0; If the City Council is the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body, the resolution to &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt; or modify, in whole or in part, shall only be adopted by at least a two-thirds vote of the whole Council.&#xA0; For all &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; bodies, any resolution to approve must contain the same &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; required to be made by the initial decision-maker, supported by &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;facts&lt;/span&gt; in the record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	6.	Procedures and Effective Date of &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Appellate&lt;/span&gt; Decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(a)	When a conditional use decision is appealed to the City Council and the Council either approves the conditional use or denies an &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; from an earlier approval, the matter together with the files and reports shall forthwith be transmitted to the Mayor.&#xA0; The Mayor may approve or disapprove the conditional use within ten days of its presentation to him or her.&#xA0; This action shall be based solely upon the administrative record and whether the Mayor believes the conditional use conforms with the requirements for approval set forth in this section.&#xA0; If the Mayor disapproves the conditional use, he or she shall return the matter to the City Clerk for presentation to the Council, together with the objections in writing.&#xA0; The Council within 60 days after the matter has been returned to it may override the disapproval:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	by a two-thirds vote if the Council had not modified the conditional use as approved by the initial decision-maker, or if the Council had made the initial approval of the conditional use by reason of the failure of the initial decision-maker to act; or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(ii)	by a three-fourths vote if the Council had modified and approved the conditional use or reversed the action of the initial decision-maker and had approved the conditional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	If the Council fails to override the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval within the 60 days, the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval shall constitute a denial of the conditional use.&#xA0; If the Mayor fails to return the matter to the City Clerk within ten days of its presentation to him or her, the approval of the conditional use shall become final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(b)	When a conditional use decision of the Zoning Administrator is appealed to an Area Planning Commission, the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; decision of the Area Planning Commission shall be final and effective as provided in Charter Section 245.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	J.	(Deleted by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5/20/12.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	K.	Limitation upon Approval of Planned Residential Developments.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the approval of any planned residential development as a conditional use shall not be complete or effective until the approval and the conditions imposed have been approved by &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;ordinance&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	L.	Existing Uses.&#xA0; Any lot or portion of a lot which is being lawfully used for any of the purposes enumerated in this section at the time the property is first classified in a zone in which the use is permitted only by conditional use or at the time the use in that zone first becomes subject to the requirements of this section, shall be deemed to be approved for the conditional use and may be continued on the lot. Further, the conditions included in any special district &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;ordinance&lt;/span&gt;, exception or variance which authorized the use shall also continue in effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Any lot or portion of a lot in the C2, C3, C4, CM or M1 Zones which was being used on June 1, 1951, for the temporary storage of abandoned, dismantled, partially dismantled, obsolete or wrecked automobiles, but not for the dismantling or wrecking of automobiles nor for the storage or sale of used parts, may continue to be so used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Regulations governing yards, &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;accessory&lt;/span&gt; buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks shall conform to the provisions of Title 25 of the California Administrative Code or any amendments.&#xA0; If yards, &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;accessory&lt;/span&gt; buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks are not regulated by Title 25, they shall conform to all applicable provisions of this Code or any other conditions imposed by the City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Any CM uses lawfully existing prior to March 22, 1981, in any portion of any building in the C5 Zone shall not be extended beyond that portion of the building except as provided by Section 12.24W of this Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	M.	Development of Uses.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,992, Eff. 7/6/01.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	1.	Development of Site.&#xA0; On any lot or portion of a lot on which a deemed- approved conditional use is permitted pursuant to the provisions of this section, new buildings or structures may be erected, enlargements may be made to existing buildings, and existing uses may be extended on an approved site, as permitted in Subsection L of this section, provided that plans are submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission, whichever has &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt; at the time. The Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission may deny the plans if the Zoning Administrator or the Commission finds that the use does not conform to the purpose and &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; required for a conditional use under this section, and may specify the conditions under which the plans may be approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission may delegate to the Director of Planning the authority to approve or disapprove, on their behalf, plans for the development of an approved or deemed-approved conditional use site.&#xA0; The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission shall establish reasonable guidelines and policies to be followed in the exercise of the delegated authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	EXCEPTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	A plan approval shall not be required in the following instances:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(a)	For buildings within mobilehome parks located in the M2 Zone, which existed in that zone on September 3, 1961, provided that the entire approval site is retained for mobilehome park use and there is no increase in the number of mobilehome sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(b)	For temporary structures erected on the site of a place of worship in an A Zone, if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(1)	the structures are erected and maintained not more than five days in any one year;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(2)	all structures, including temporary facilities, are located at least 40 feet from all exterior lot lines;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(3)	the required permits are obtained from the Fire Department, and all structures are removed from the premises the next day following the closing of the event;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(4)	no public address system in connection with the event is installed on the property unless it is modulated so as not to be disturbing to occupants of nearby dwelling units; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(5)	any lights used to illuminate the area are arranged to reflect the light away from any adjacent residentially used premises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	2.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Appeal&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; the decision to the Area Planning Commission pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.&#xA0; An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; the decision to the City Council pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	N.	Reduction of Site. &#xA0; So long as the conditional use is continued, the entire approved site shall be retained for the conditional use, and no portion shall be severed from the site or utilized for other purposes unless the plans for the reduced site are first submitted to and approved by the initial decision-maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	The decision of an initial decision-maker on a proposed reduction of the area of an approved site shall be subject to the same &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; procedures as is provided for an application to establish the conditional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	O.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Findings&lt;/span&gt; and Conditions of Approval.&#xA0; In approving any conditional use plans, the initial decision-maker must find that the use conforms to the purpose and &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; required for a conditional use under this section and may impose conditions on the same basis as provided for in this section for the establishment of new conditional uses.&#xA0; The initial decision-maker shall adopt written &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt; supporting the decision based upon &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt; in the record, including any investigations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	P.	Change of Use.&#xA0; No conditional use may be changed to a different type of conditional use unless the new use is authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Q.	Discontinuance of Use.&#xA0; If a conditional use is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not be re-established unless authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	R.	Planned Residential Developments or Housing Projects Approved as Conditional Uses.&#xA0; No provision of Section 13.04 of this Code shall be construed as limiting or modifying the provisions of any conditional use approval, or any other right already existing, for a housing project or planned residential development granted prior to the effective date of that section.&#xA0; The provisions of this section shall continue to apply to those developments, and the Commission is authorized to perform all required administrative acts.&#xA0; Provided, however, if a conditional use for a housing project or planned residential development approved prior to the effective date of Section 13.04 is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be re-established unless authorized as a Residential Planned Development Supplemental Use District.&#xA0; The planned residential development shall not be divided or separated in ownership unless authorized under supplemental use district procedures as a residential planned development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	S.	As part of any conditional use approval, the initial decision-maker or the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body may approve changes to the parking requirements not to exceed 20% of the requirements otherwise required by the Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	T.

No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; A reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4. may be permitted by the Director as the initial decision-maker or by the Area Planning Commission as the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appellate&lt;/span&gt; body.&#xA0; The procedures for decisions on these uses shall be the same as those for variances as provided in Section 12.27 B. in addition to those set out below, except that the initial decision-maker shall be the Director, there is only one level of &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt; necessary to grant the reduction shall be that the action is in conformity with the public necessity, convenience, general welfare and good zoning practice and that the action will be in substantial conformance with the various elements and objectives of the General Plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	If the Director finds that a commercial or industrial building is located on a lot not more than 1,500 feet distant from the portal of a fixed rail transit station, or bus station, or other similar transit facility, then the required number of parking spaces for that commercial or industrial building shall be decreased by ten percent of the number otherwise required by Section 12.21 A.4.(c).&#xA0; If the Director makes this &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;finding&lt;/span&gt;, then no more than 90 percent of the parking spaces required by Section 12.21 A.4.(c) of this subdivision are required to be provided on the lot.&#xA0; The 1,500-foot distance shall be measured as specified in Section 12.21 A.4.(g).&#xA0; A portal shall be defined as the street-level entrance, exit or escalator of a transit station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	A station may be used as the basis of a reduction if the Director decides that it is currently in use; that a full funding &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;contract&lt;/span&gt; for a proposed station&#x2019;s location and portals have been signed by all funding partners; or that a resolution to fund a preferred alignment has been adopted by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission by a resolution detailing specific stations and portal locations.&#xA0; Before approving a parking reduction application filed pursuant to this subdivision, a Director shall find that the surrounding area will not be adversely affected by overflow parking or traffic congestion originating or terminating at the lot, and that the reduction will not otherwise be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the properties or improvements in the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	In the following cases, an application pursuant to this subsection shall be set for public &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; and notice shall be given pursuant to Section 12.27 C.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(i)	when it can reasonably be anticipated that approval of the application could have a significant adverse effect on adjoining properties or on the immediate neighborhood; or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	(ii)	when the application is likely to evoke public controversy.&#xA0; In all other cases an application pursuant to this subdivision need not be set for public &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt;, unless the Director determines that a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt; would further the public interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	A copy of each application shall be promptly submitted to the Councilmember of the district in which the property is located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Z.	&lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Revocation&lt;/span&gt;.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; If the conditions of any conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approvals granted pursuant to this section have not been complied with, the Director, or the City Planning Commission if the approval or conditional use was granted by the City Planning Commission, upon knowledge of the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt; of non-compliance, may give notice to the record owner or lessee of the real property affected to appear at a time and place fixed by the City Planning Commission or Director and show cause why the decision granting the approval or conditional use should not be repealed or rescinded, as the case may be.&#xA0; The City Planning Commission may delegate its authority in this matter to the Director.&#xA0; After the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;hearing&lt;/span&gt;, the City Planning Commission or the Director may revoke the conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval.&#xA0; An &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; from this &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;revocation&lt;/span&gt; action may be taken to the City Council in the same manner prescribed in Subsection I.&#xA0; The City Council&#x2019;s decision on &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;appeal&lt;/span&gt; shall be reviewable as an approval of a conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval in the manner prescribed in Subsection I.6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	After &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;revocation&lt;/span&gt;, the property affected shall be subject to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as provided in this article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	AA.	Additional &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;Revocation&lt;/span&gt; Authority.&#xA0; The Director may require the modification, discontinuance, or &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;revocation&lt;/span&gt; of any conditional use or other similar quasi-judicial approval granted in accordance with the procedure in this section in the manner prescribed in Section 12.27.1.&#xA0; In the event of a &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;revocation&lt;/span&gt;, the property affected by the &lt;span class="dictionary"&gt;revocation&lt;/span&gt; shall be subject to all the regulations of the zone in which the property is located, as provided in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</html><previous_section id="3237"><structure_id>20</structure_id><section_number>12.23</section_number><catch_line>Nonconforming Building And Uses.</catch_line><url>/12.23/</url><token>12.23</token></previous_section><text><unit id="1178" prefix=""><text>&#xA0; CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS AND OTHER SIMILAR QUASI-JUDICIAL APPROVALS.

No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; This section shall apply to the conditional use approvals listed in Subsections U, V and W and to the other similar quasi-judicial approvals listed in Subsection X.&#xA0; These procedures apply only to uses in zones when not permitted by right.	B.	Application for Permit.&#xA0; To apply for a permit, an applicant shall file an application with the Department of City Planning, on a form provided by the Department, and include all information required by the instructions on the application and the guidelines adopted by the Director of Planning.&#xA0; The Director of Planning shall adopt guidelines which shall be used to determine when an application is deemed complete.	C.	Initial Decision.&#xA0; Except as otherwise provided in Charter Section 564 and Section 12.36 of this Code, the initial decision on an application shall be made by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission, as prescribed in Subsections U, V, W and X.	For purposes of this section, the initial decision shall mean approval in whole or in part with or without conditions, or denial of the application.	D.	Public Hearing and Notice.&#xA0; Upon receipt of a complete application, the initial decision-maker shall set the matter for public hearing at which evidence shall be taken and may conduct the hearing itself or may designate a hearing officer to conduct the hearing.	The Department shall give notice in all of the following manners:	1.

(a)	By mailing a written notice no less than 24 days prior to the date of the hearing to the applicant, the owner or owners of the property involved, and to the owners of all property within and outside of the City that is within 500 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved, using for the purpose of notification, the last known name and address of owners as shown on the records of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor.&#xA0; Where all property within the 500-foot radius is under the same ownership as the property involved in the application, the owners of all property that adjoins that ownership, or is separated from it only by a street, alley, public right-of-way or other easement, shall also be notified as set forth above; and&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff. 4/10/11.)	(b)	By mailing a written notice no less than 24 days prior to the date of the hearing to residential, commercial and industrial occupants of all property within 500 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved.&#xA0; This requirement can be met by mailing the notice to &#x201C;occupant&#x201D;; and	(c)	If notice pursuant to Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will not result in notice being given to at least 20 different owners of at least 20 different lots other than the subject property, then the 500-foot radius for notification shall be increased in increments of 50 feet until the required number of persons and lots are encompassed within the expanded area.&#xA0; Notification shall then be given to all property owners and occupants within the expanded area.	3.	Site Posting.&#xA0; By the applicant posting notice of the public hearing in a conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing.&#xA0; If a hearing examiner is designated to conduct the public hearing, then the applicant, in addition to posting notice of the public hearing, shall also post notice of the initial meeting of the decision-making body on the matter.&#xA0; This notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property involved at least ten days prior to the date of the meeting.&#xA0; The Director of Planning may adopt guidelines consistent with this section for the posting of notices if the Director determines that those guidelines are necessary and appropriate.	E.	Findings for Approval.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)&#xA0; A decision-maker shall not grant a conditional use or other approval specified in Subsections U., V., W., or X. of this Section without finding:	1.	that the project will enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood or will perform a function or provide a service that is essential or beneficial to the community, city, or region;	2.	that the project&#x2019;s location, size, height, operations and other significant features will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare, and safety; and	3.	that the project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan, and any applicable specific plan.	The decision-maker shall also make any additional findings required by Subsections U., V., W. and X., and shall determine that the project satisfies all applicable requirements in those subsections.	F.	Conditions of Approval.&#xA0; In approving a project, the decision-maker may impose conditions related to the interests addressed in the findings set forth in Subsection E.&#xA0; The decision may state that the height and area regulations required by other provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to the conditional use approved.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 182,095, Eff. 5/7/12.)	G.	Time to Act.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,492, Eff. 10/10/00.)&#xA0; The initial decision shall be made within 75 days of the date the application is deemed complete, or within an extended period as mutually agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the decision-maker.&#xA0; An initial decision shall not be considered made until written findings are adopted in accordance with Subsection E. &#xA0; Upon making its decision, the initial decision-maker shall transmit a copy of the written findings and decision to the applicant, to all owners of properties abutting, across the street or alley from, or having a common corner with the subject property and to all persons who have filed a written request for the notice with the Department of City Planning.	Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, the initial decision-maker shall make its decision on any application for a hazardous waste storage, treatment, or disposal facility, as governed by Subdivisions 10 and 11 of Subsection U of this section, pursuant to the time limits as set forth in Article 8.7 of the California Health and Safety Code.	H.	Failure to Act &#x2013; Transfer of Jurisdiction.	1.	If the initial decision-maker fails to act on an application within 75 days from the date of filing a complete application, or within a mutually agreed upon extension of time, the applicant may file a request for a transfer of jurisdiction to the designated appellate body for decision.&#xA0; The designated appellate body is the body to whom the matter would normally be appealable, pursuant to Subsections U, V, W and X.&#xA0; The Director of Planning shall prescribe the form and manner of filing requests for transfers of jurisdiction.	2.	When the designated appellate body receives the applicant&#x2019;s request for a transfer of jurisdiction, the initial decision-maker shall lose jurisdiction.&#xA0; However, the body to whom the matter is transferred may remand the matter to the initial decision-maker who shall regain jurisdiction for the time and purpose specified in the remand action.&#xA0; In addition, upon receipt of a written request by the applicant for withdrawal of the transfer of jurisdiction prior to the matter being heard by the appellate body, the matter shall be remanded to the initial decision-maker.	3.	If the matter is not remanded, the decision-maker to whom the matter has been transferred shall consider the application following the same procedures and subject to the same limitations as are applicable to the initial decision-maker, except that the body to which the matter has been transferred shall act within 45 days of the transfer of jurisdiction.&#xA0; The Department of City Planning, including the Office of Zoning Administration, shall make investigations and furnish any reports requested by the body to which the matter has been transferred.	I.	Appeals.	1.	Effective Date of Initial Decision.&#xA0; An initial decision becomes final and effective upon the close of the 15-day appeal period if not appealed, or as provided in this subsection if appealed.	2.	Filing of an Appeal.&#xA0; An applicant or any other person aggrieved by the initial decision of the Zoning Administrator may appeal the decision to the Area Planning Commission.&#xA0; An applicant or any other person aggrieved by the initial decision of the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission may appeal the decision to the City Council.&#xA0; The appeal shall be filed within 15 days of the date of mailing of the initial decision on forms provided by the Department.&#xA0; The appeal shall set forth specifically the points at issue, the reasons for the appeal, and the basis upon which the appellant claims there was an error or abuse of discretion by the initial decision-maker.&#xA0; Any appeal not filed within the 15-day period shall not be considered by the appellate body.&#xA0; The filing of an appeal stays proceedings in the matter until the appellate body has made a decision.&#xA0; Once an appeal is filed, the initial decision-maker shall transmit the appeal and the file to the appellate body, together with any report if one was prepared by staff responding to the allegations made in the appeal.	3.	Appellate Decision &#x2013; Public Hearing and Notice.&#xA0; Before acting on any appeal, the appellate body shall set the matter for hearing, giving the same notice as provided for the original hearing.&#xA0; When considering an appeal from the decision of an initial decision-maker, the appellate body shall make its decision, based on the record, as to whether the initial decision-maker erred or abused his or her discretion.	4.	Time for Appellate Decision.&#xA0; The appellate body shall act within 75 days after the expiration of the appeal period or within any additional period mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the appellate body.&#xA0; The failure of the appellate body to adopt a resolution within this time period shall be deemed a denial of the appeal.	5.	Appellate Decision.&#xA0; The appellate body may, by resolution, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, any decision of the initial decision-maker.&#xA0; If the City Council is the appellate body, the resolution to reverse or modify, in whole or in part, shall only be adopted by at least a two-thirds vote of the whole Council.&#xA0; For all appellate bodies, any resolution to approve must contain the same findings required to be made by the initial decision-maker, supported by facts in the record.	6.	Procedures and Effective Date of Appellate Decision.	(a)	When a conditional use decision is appealed to the City Council and the Council either approves the conditional use or denies an appeal from an earlier approval, the matter together with the files and reports shall forthwith be transmitted to the Mayor.&#xA0; The Mayor may approve or disapprove the conditional use within ten days of its presentation to him or her.&#xA0; This action shall be based solely upon the administrative record and whether the Mayor believes the conditional use conforms with the requirements for approval set forth in this section.&#xA0; If the Mayor disapproves the conditional use, he or she shall return the matter to the City Clerk for presentation to the Council, together with the objections in writing.&#xA0; The Council within 60 days after the matter has been returned to it may override the disapproval:	(i)	by a two-thirds vote if the Council had not modified the conditional use as approved by the initial decision-maker, or if the Council had made the initial approval of the conditional use by reason of the failure of the initial decision-maker to act; or	(ii)	by a three-fourths vote if the Council had modified and approved the conditional use or reversed the action of the initial decision-maker and had approved the conditional use.	If the Council fails to override the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval within the 60 days, the Mayor&#x2019;s disapproval shall constitute a denial of the conditional use.&#xA0; If the Mayor fails to return the matter to the City Clerk within ten days of its presentation to him or her, the approval of the conditional use shall become final.	(b)	When a conditional use decision of the Zoning Administrator is appealed to an Area Planning Commission, the appellate decision of the Area Planning Commission shall be final and effective as provided in Charter Section 245.	J.	(Deleted by Ord. No. 182,106, Eff. 5/20/12.)	K.	Limitation upon Approval of Planned Residential Developments.&#xA0; Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the approval of any planned residential development as a conditional use shall not be complete or effective until the approval and the conditions imposed have been approved by ordinance.	L.	Existing Uses.&#xA0; Any lot or portion of a lot which is being lawfully used for any of the purposes enumerated in this section at the time the property is first classified in a zone in which the use is permitted only by conditional use or at the time the use in that zone first becomes subject to the requirements of this section, shall be deemed to be approved for the conditional use and may be continued on the lot. Further, the conditions included in any special district ordinance, exception or variance which authorized the use shall also continue in effect.	Any lot or portion of a lot in the C2, C3, C4, CM or M1 Zones which was being used on June 1, 1951, for the temporary storage of abandoned, dismantled, partially dismantled, obsolete or wrecked automobiles, but not for the dismantling or wrecking of automobiles nor for the storage or sale of used parts, may continue to be so used.	Regulations governing yards, accessory buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks shall conform to the provisions of Title 25 of the California Administrative Code or any amendments.&#xA0; If yards, accessory buildings, parking, access, or any other internal features of mobilehome parks are not regulated by Title 25, they shall conform to all applicable provisions of this Code or any other conditions imposed by the City.	Any CM uses lawfully existing prior to March 22, 1981, in any portion of any building in the C5 Zone shall not be extended beyond that portion of the building except as provided by Section 12.24W of this Code.	M.	Development of Uses.&#xA0; (Amended by Ord. No. 173,992, Eff. 7/6/01.)	1.	Development of Site.&#xA0; On any lot or portion of a lot on which a deemed- approved conditional use is permitted pursuant to the provisions of this section, new buildings or structures may be erected, enlargements may be made to existing buildings, and existing uses may be extended on an approved site, as permitted in Subsection L of this section, provided that plans are submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission, whichever has jurisdiction at the time. The Zoning Administrator, the Area Planning Commission, or the City Planning Commission may deny the plans if the Zoning Administrator or the Commission finds that the use does not conform to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a conditional use under this section, and may specify the conditions under which the plans may be approved.	The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission may delegate to the Director of Planning the authority to approve or disapprove, on their behalf, plans for the development of an approved or deemed-approved conditional use site.&#xA0; The Area Planning Commission and the City Planning Commission shall establish reasonable guidelines and policies to be followed in the exercise of the delegated authority.	EXCEPTIONS:	A plan approval shall not be required in the following instances:	(a)	For buildings within mobilehome parks located in the M2 Zone, which existed in that zone on September 3, 1961, provided that the entire approval site is retained for mobilehome park use and there is no increase in the number of mobilehome sites.	(b)	For temporary structures erected on the site of a place of worship in an A Zone, if:	(1)	the structures are erected and maintained not more than five days in any one year;	(2)	all structures, including temporary facilities, are located at least 40 feet from all exterior lot lines;	(3)	the required permits are obtained from the Fire Department, and all structures are removed from the premises the next day following the closing of the event;	(4)	no public address system in connection with the event is installed on the property unless it is modulated so as not to be disturbing to occupants of nearby dwelling units; and	(5)	any lights used to illuminate the area are arranged to reflect the light away from any adjacent residentially used premises.	2.	Appeal.&#xA0; An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may appeal the decision to the Area Planning Commission pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.&#xA0; An applicant submitting development plans or any other person aggrieved by the decision of the Area Planning Commission or the City Planning Commission made relative to the approval or disapproval of a development plan may appeal the decision to the City Council pursuant to this section and Section 19.00.	N.	Reduction of Site. &#xA0; So long as the conditional use is continued, the entire approved site shall be retained for the conditional use, and no portion shall be severed from the site or utilized for other purposes unless the plans for the reduced site are first submitted to and approved by the initial decision-maker.	The decision of an initial decision-maker on a proposed reduction of the area of an approved site shall be subject to the same appeal procedures as is provided for an application to establish the conditional use.	O.	Findings and Conditions of Approval.&#xA0; In approving any conditional use plans, the initial decision-maker must find that the use conforms to the purpose and intent of the findings required for a conditional use under this section and may impose conditions on the same basis as provided for in this section for the establishment of new conditional uses.&#xA0; The initial decision-maker shall adopt written findings of fact supporting the decision based upon evidence in the record, including any investigations.	P.	Change of Use.&#xA0; No conditional use may be changed to a different type of conditional use unless the new use is authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.	Q.	Discontinuance of Use.&#xA0; If a conditional use is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not be re-established unless authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for the establishment of a conditional use.	R.	Planned Residential Developments or Housing Projects Approved as Conditional Uses.&#xA0; No provision of Section 13.04 of this Code shall be construed as limiting or modifying the provisions of any conditional use approval, or any other right already existing, for a housing project or planned residential development granted prior to the effective date of that section.&#xA0; The provisions of this section shall continue to apply to those developments, and the Commission is authorized to perform all required administrative acts.&#xA0; Provided, however, if a conditional use for a housing project or planned residential development approved prior to the effective date of Section 13.04 is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be re-established unless authorized as a Residential Planned Development Supplemental Use District.&#xA0; The planned residential development shall not be divided or separated in ownership unless authorized under supplemental use district procedures as a residential planned development.	S.	As part of any conditional use approval, the initial decision-maker or the appellate body may approve changes to the parking requirements not to exceed 20% of the requirements otherwise required by the Code.	T.	Vesting Conditional Use Applications.	1.	Application.&#xA0; Whenever a provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code requires the filing of an application for a conditional use permit, a vesting conditional use permit may be filed instead, in accordance with these provisions.&#xA0; If an applicant does not seek the rights conferred by this subsection, the filing of a vesting application shall not be required by the City for the approval of any proposed zone change, conditional use permit, permit for construction or work preparatory to construction.	2.	Development Rights.	(a)	The approval of a vesting application shall confer a vested right to proceed with a development in substantial compliance with the rules, regulations, ordinances, zones and officially adopted policies of the City of Los Angeles in force on the date the application is deemed complete, and with the conditions of approval imposed and specifically enumerated by the decision maker in its action on the vesting application case.&#xA0; These rights shall not include exemption from other applications or approvals that may be necessary to entitle a project to proceed (i.e., subdivision, parcel map, zone variance, design review, etc.) and from subsequent changes in the Building and Safety and Fire regulations contained in Chapters V and IX of the Los Angeles Municipal Code found necessary by the City Council to protect the public health and safety and which are applicable on a citywide basis and policies and standards relating to those regulations or from citywide programs enacted after the application is deemed complete to implement State or Federal mandates.	(b)	If the ordinances, policies, or standards described in the preceding paragraph are changed subsequent to the approval or conditional approval of a vesting application case, the applicant, or his or her successor or assignee, at any time prior to the expiration of the vesting application case, may apply, pursuant to Subdivision 4 of this subsection, for an amendment to the vesting application case to secure a vested right to proceed with the changed ordinances, policies, or standards.&#xA0; An application shall clearly specify the changed ordinances, policies, or standards for which the amendment is sought.	(c)	Prior to final approval or signoff on a building permit filed pursuant to a vesting application, the Planning Department shall submit a copy of the final site plan to the office of the affected council district for informational purposes only.	3.
