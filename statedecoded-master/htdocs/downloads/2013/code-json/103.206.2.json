The bill shall be due and payable to the Office of Finance within fifteen days of the billing date.\n\n\t2.\tIf the Office of Finance determines for any billing that a discrepancy exists between the service fee paid and the amount billed which results in an underpayment or overpayment in an amount of three dollars or less, the Office of Finance may accept and record the billing as paid in full without other notification to the person billed.\n\n\t3.\tIf the Office of Finance determines that any amount of the service fee billed hereunder cannot be collected or that efforts to collect would be disproportionately costly in relation to the probable outcome of the collection efforts, the Office of Finance may prepare a report setting forth the findings and reasons therefor and request that the Board of Review authorize the removal of any unpaid amount from the active accounts receivable of the Department pursuant to Section 11.04 of this Code.\u00a0 Upon unanimous approval of the Board of\u00a0 Review, the Office of Finance may remove from the active accounts receivable any service fee owing.\u00a0 If the Board of Review does not unanimously approve the findings, the matter shall be returned to the Office of Finance.\u00a0 Any removal, however, shall not preclude the Office of Finance from collecting\u00a0 or attempting to collect any such sum that later proves to be collectible as provided by Section 11.04.\n\n\t4.\tAt least monthly the Office of Finance shall report to the Department the outstanding accounts receivable, collections and write offs of service fees.\n\n\t5.\tAdministrative Cost.\u00a0 The total cost covered in Paragraph 1 of this subsection shall include, in addition to the cost to perform the actual work, an amount equal to forty percent
