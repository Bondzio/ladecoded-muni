	(Amended by Ord. No. 136,861, Eff. 8/19/68.)

	(a)	The Director of Finance may make an assessment for taxes not remitted by a person required to remit for any reason specified in Sec. 21.16 of this chapter for making an assessment for unpaid Business Tax.

	(b)	Whenever the Director of Finance determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by him from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or that a service user has failed to pay the amount of the tax to such person for a period of two or more billing periods, or whenever the Director of Finance deems it in the best interests of the City, he may relieve such person of the obligation to collect taxes due under this article from certain named service users for specified billing periods. The Office of Finance shall notify the service user that he has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. (Sentence Amended by Ord. No. 173,587, Eff. 12/7/00.)&#xA0; The notice shall be served on the service user by handing it to him personally or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have changed his address, to his last known address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the Director of Finance within fifteen days from the date of the service of the notice upon him, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than $5.00. The penalty shall become part of the tax herein required to be paid.</full_text><order_by>1.10</order_by><ancestry><unit id="62" label="article"><name>
