AUTHORITY TO RECOVER COSTS FOR ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES. (§ 57.01.19)

  AUTHORITY TO RECOVER COSTS FOR ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)	In the event a public nuisance
caused by the presence of flammable or hazardous materials is abated by the Fire
Department, either pursuant to its authority under this Code or upon request by
any other City department, or is abated by any other City department having
authority to abate the nuisance, the costs of abatement, including any cost
incurred by the City in using non-City personnel to abate the nuisance, shall be
recovered by the City from the person or persons creating, causing, committing,
or maintaining the nuisance.	All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall
be a personal obligation against the person or persons creating, causing,
committing, or maintaining the nuisance and the owner of the property,
recoverable by the City in an action before any court of competent
jurisdiction.  These costs shall include an amount equal to 40 percent of the
cost to perform the actual work, but not less than the sum of $100.00, to cover
the City’s costs for administering any contract and supervising the work
required.  In addition to this personal obligation and all other remedies
provided by law, the City may collect any judgment, fee, cost, or charge,
including any permit fees, fines, late charges, or interest, incurred in
relation to the provisions of this section as provided in Los Angeles
Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.
