GRADING DESIGNATION. (§ 91.7004)

  GRADING DESIGNATION.
	(Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)	Grading in designated hillside
areas or in excess of 5,000 cubic yards (3825 m3) of either cut or fill, or a
combination thereof, shall be performed in accordance with the approved grading
plan prepared by a civil engineer, and shall be designated as “engineered
grading”.  Grading involving less than 5,000 cubic yards (3825 m3) in a non
hillside area shall be designated “regular grading” unless the permittee
chooses to have the grading performed as engineered grading, or the
Superintendent of Building determines that special conditions or unusual hazards
exist, in which case grading shall conform to the requirements for engineered
grading.
