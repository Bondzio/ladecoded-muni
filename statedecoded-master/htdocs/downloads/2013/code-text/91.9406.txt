  ANALYSIS AND DESIGN.
	(Added by Ord. No. 171,258, Eff. 8/30/96.)91.9406.1.  General.  Every
hillside building within the scope of this division shall be analyzed, designed,
and constructed in accordance with the following provisions.91.9406.1.1.  Base
for Seismic Design Defined.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper.
1/1/08.)  The base for seismic design is defined as
follows:	1.	Downhill-Direction.  For seismic forces acting in the
downhill-direction, the base of the building shall be the floor at or closest to
the top of the highest level of the foundation.	2.	Normal to the
Downhill-Direction.  For seismic forces acting normal to the
downhill-direction, the distribution of seismic forces over the height of the
building using Section 12.8.3 of ASCE 7 shall be determined using the height
measured from the top of the lowest level of the building foundation. 
Retrofitting, however, shall only be required at the base-level-diaphragm and
below.91.9406.1.2.  Design Base Shear.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff.
12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  The design base shear shall be that required at the
time of the original building permit 75% less than currently required by Section
12.8.1 of ASCE 7, but not less than the following:	V = 0.133 W.		Where:	V 	=	The
total design lateral force or shear at the base.	W	=	The total seismic dead load
defined in Section 12.7.2 of ASCE 7.91.9406.2.  Base Shear Resistance in the
Downhill-Direction.91.9406.2.1.  General.  The base shear in the
downhill-direction, including forces from the base-level-diaphragm, shall be
resisted through primary anchors from diaphragm struts or collectors provided in
the base level framing to the foundation.91.9406.2.2.  Location of Primary
Anchors.  A primary anchor and diaphragm strut or collector shall be provided
in line with each foundation extending in the downhill-direction.  Primary
anchors and diaphragm struts or collectors shall also be provided where interior
vertical lateral force resisting elements occur above and in contact with the
base-level-diaphragm.	The base-level-diaphragm shall be provided with primary
anchors designed for the tributary forces spaced at a maximum 30 feet (9145 mm)
on center.  Where the floor below the base extends to the uphill foundation,
and the foundation at the base  is not adequate to resist the forces from the
primary anchors, the base shear may be transferred to that lower level and the
primary anchorage made at that lower level.  The connection shall be made
directly to the foundation.  The existing foundation shall be evaluated as
specified in Section 91.9406.11.91.9406.3.  Seismic Forces on Floor Levels
Below the Base in the Downhill- Direction.91.9406.3.1.  General.  All  floor
diaphragm connections between floor diaphragms below the base level diaphragm
shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of this
section.91.9406.3.2.  Design.  Each floor level below the base defined in
Section 91.9406.1.1 shall be designed for all tributary loads at that level
using a minimum seismic force factor not less than the base shear
coefficient.91.9406.3.3.  Direct Connections.  (Each floor level shall be
directly connected to the foundation through a system of primary anchors at that
level as required for the base  as specified in Section
91.9406.1.1.91.9406.4.  Secondary Anchors from Diaphragm to Foundation for 
Seismic Forces at and Below the Base  in the Downhill-Direction.91.9406.4.1. 
General.  In addition to the anchors required by Sections 91.9406.2 and
91.9406.3, the floor diaphragm for levels at and below the base shall be
anchored to the uphill foundation at the level of the diaphragm, as specified in
this section.	EXCEPTION:  Secondary anchors are not required where:	1.	the
concrete or masonry foundations in the downhill-direction are spaced at not more
than 30 feet (9145 mm) on center and extend up to and are directly connected to
the base-level-diaphragm for at least 70 percent of the diaphragm depth;
or	2.	the diaphragm is separated from the mudsill at the uphill foundation by a
cripple wall which has anchor bolts and is braced in the plane of the wall and
constructed with studs that are no less than 12 inches (305 mm) in height and
primary anchors are spaced a maximum of 20 feet (6096 mm) on center; or	3.	the
deflection of the plywood floor diaphragm between adjacent primary anchors is
calculated to be less than 1/4 of an inch (6.4 mm).91.9406.4.2.  Diaphragm

primary anchorage design force at that level divided by the length of the uphill
diaphragm edge, but shall not be less than 300 pounds per lineal foot (4.37
kN/m).  The existing foundation need not be checked to resist the additional
forces induced by the system of secondary anchors; however, the existing
foundation shall be evaluated as specified in Section 91.9406.11.91.9406.5. 
Design of Anchorage.91.9406.5.1.  General.  Primary and secondary anchors, and

179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  The distribution of seismic forces
acting normal to the downhill-direction shall be determined using Section 12.8.3
of ASCE 7.  The height of the structure in Equation (12.8-12) of Section 12.8.3

the story height.  The total drift from the base-level-diaphragm to the top of
the foundation shall not exceed 3/4 inch (19 mm).  Where the story height or
the height  from the base-level-diaphragm to the top of the foundation varies
because of a stepped footing or story offset, the height shall be measured from
the average height of the top of the foundation.  The calculated story drift
shall not be reduced by the effect of horizontal diaphragm
stiffness.91.9406.7.  Lateral Force Resisting Systems at the Base  and Below

heights in accordance with the stiffness of each individual element.  The
stiffness of a stepped wood structural panel shear wall may be determined by
dividing the wall into adjacent rectangular elements, subject to the same top of
wall deflection.  Deflections of shear walls may be estimated by CBC Sections
2305.3.2 and 2305.3.8.2.9 or other equivalent methods.  Sheathing and fastening
requirements for the stiffest section shall be used for the entire wall.  Each

braced frames with concentric connections may be used as part of the lateral
force resisting system.  All members in braced frames shall be designed to
resist tension and compression forces.  Seismic forces shall not induce
flexural stresses in any member of the frame, in diaphragm struts, or in the
collectors.  Where existing anchor bolts are used for anchorage, existing

necessary.  When the braced frame is not rectangular, distribution of forces to
members shall account for the variations in slope.91.9406.7.4.  Rod-Braced
Frames and Diaphragms.  Existing tension only braces may be used provided they
resist five times the design force, and the connections have the capacity to

installed on each side of the beam web at the column supports and points of
concentrated load.  The stiffener plates shall be welded to each beam flange
