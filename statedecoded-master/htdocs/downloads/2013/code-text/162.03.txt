  REFERRAL TO REAP.
	(Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)	Any City or County agency or any
tenant may refer any building or residential unit within the scope of this
article to the Department for inclusion in REAP if the following conditions are
met:	i.	The building or unit is the subject of one or more Orders;	ii.	The
period allowed by the Order for compliance, including any extensions, has
expired without compliance; and	iii.	The violation affects the health or safety
of the occupants, or, if the unit is subject to the RSO, the violation results
in a deprivation of housing services, as defined in Section 151.02, or a
habitability violation, as defined in Section 153.02.	In its referral, the City
or County agency shall indicate if the violations are of a nature or extent that
they are likely to exist in or affect units that have not been inspected.  The
RAC shall promulgate regulations setting forth criteria for determining when
that condition exists.
