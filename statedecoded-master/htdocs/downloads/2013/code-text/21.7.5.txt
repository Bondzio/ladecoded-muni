OPERATOR’S DUTIES. (§ 21.7.5)

  OPERATOR’S DUTIES.	Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this
article to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from
every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of
the rent charged and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner herein provided.
